# Changelog -- macparakeet-cli

All notable changes to the **`macparakeet-cli` surface** are documented here.

This file tracks the CLI specifically -- the commands, flags, output schemas,
and exit codes that scripted callers (shell scripts, CI pipelines, AI agents)
depend on. App-level changes ship through Sparkle and are documented in the
appcast at <https://macparakeet.com/appcast.xml>.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com), and the
CLI adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## Compatibility policy

The CLI surface is a public contract. We follow semver:

- **MAJOR** -- any change that breaks scripted callers: removed commands,
  renamed flags, removed JSON fields, changed exit-code meanings, changed
  default behavior of an existing flag.
- **MINOR** -- additive changes: new commands, new flags, new optional JSON
  fields, new exit codes for new error classes.
- **PATCH** -- bug fixes, output formatting tweaks that preserve schema,
  documentation, performance work.

When we deprecate a command or flag, the old name keeps working for **at least
one minor release** with a clear `--help` notice and a CHANGELOG callout. New
names are added first; old names are removed only at a MAJOR boundary.

JSON output schemas are part of the contract: top-level shape (array vs
object), field names, and field types are stable within a major version. We
may add new optional fields in a minor release.

### Exit codes

The CLI uses a small set of exit codes. They are part of the public contract;
new error classes get new minor-version codes, never silent reuse.

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0`  | Success. |
| `1`  | Runtime failure -- the command attempted its work and the work failed. Examples: LLM provider call returned an error, transcription failed, database read/write error, network unreachable. The command writes a one-line stderr message describing the failure. |
| `2`  | Validation/misuse -- the invocation itself was malformed before the command did any real work. Examples: unknown provider, missing required flag, malformed input file, unsupported `--format` value. ArgumentParser produces this for unknown flags as well. |
| `130` | Interrupted by `SIGINT` (Ctrl-C). Inherits Unix convention; downstream agents should treat this as cancellation, not failure. |

After argument parsing succeeds, `--json` output never goes to stderr
regardless of exit code. When `--json` is passed, both success and post-parse
failure print a JSON object to stdout; the exit code remains the source of
truth for branching.

### `--json` failure envelope

Any command that accepts `--json` emits this envelope on stdout when the
command fails *after argument parsing succeeds* — provider error, missing
input, lookup miss, runtime exception, etc.:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "human-readable message",
  "errorType": "auth"
}
```

`errorType` is a low-cardinality stable string. Current values: `auth`,
`config`, `connection`, `context`, `input_empty`, `input_missing`,
`invalid_response`, `lookup`, `model`, `provider`, `rate_limit`, `runtime`,
`streaming`, `truncated`, `validation`. New error classes get new values in
minor releases; existing values are stable within a major.

Stderr stays plain text for human-only progress / status (e.g. "Saved
PromptResult abc12345"), so piping `--json` stdout through `jq` is safe.

**Parse-time / `validate()` failures** (unknown flags, missing required
flags, mutually-exclusive flag combinations like `--json` with `--stream`)
happen before the command starts running and surface through
ArgumentParser's plain-text stderr path with exit code `2`. Downstream
agents that branch on `errorType` should also handle the parse-error case
by checking exit code first: `2` = misuse, `1` = runtime, `0` = success.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `quick-prompts` subcommand surface for managing the live meeting Ask tab
  pills (starter and follow-up prompts). Subcommands: `list`, `show`, `add`,
  `set`, `delete`, `restore-defaults`, `export`, `import`. All mutation
  subcommands honor `--json` for the success/failure envelope. Built-ins are
  user-editable; `delete` rejects them with `errorType: "validation"`.
  `import --mode merge` (default) UPSERTs by id and preserves untouched rows;
  `import --mode replace` wipes customs, re-seeds built-ins, then applies the
  file (prompts for confirmation unless `--json` or `--yes`). `import
  --dry-run` reports planned `{added, updated, deleted, unchanged}` counts
  without writing. Bundle format is versioned (`macparakeet.quick_prompts`
  v1) and round-trippable.
- `import_schema` `errorType` value for malformed quick-prompts import files
  (e.g. wrong `schema`, unsupported `version`, JSON parse failure).
- `flow vocabulary export`, `flow vocabulary import`, and `flow vocabulary
  schema` commands for round-trip backup of the combined vocabulary (custom
  words + text snippets). `import` supports `--policy skip|replace`,
  `--dry-run`, `--json`, and stdin (omit `--input`); `export` writes to
  stdout when `--output` is omitted. `schema` prints an LLM-friendly spec
  (or `--json` structured form) so a local coding agent can generate valid
  bundles. Bundle format is versioned (`macparakeet.vocabulary` v1).

### Fixed

- `transcribe --format json` and `export --format json --stdout` now emit the
  documented JSON failure envelope for post-parse failures.

## [1.4.0] -- 2026-04-28

### Added

- LLM-backed commands now accept `--api-key-env NAME`; hosted providers also
  read `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and
  `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` directly.
- `config` command namespace for users who only install the CLI (no GUI):
  `macparakeet-cli config get telemetry`, `config set telemetry on|off`, and
  `config list`. Values persist in the same UserDefaults suite the GUI reads
  (`com.macparakeet.MacParakeet`), so a later GUI install picks them up.
- `transcribe` now honors `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` (industry-standard, also honored
  by Homebrew, GitLab, VS Code) and auto-disables telemetry in CI environments
  (`CI`, `GITHUB_ACTIONS`, `GITLAB_CI`, `BUILDKITE`, `CIRCLECI`, `TRAVIS`,
  `JENKINS_URL`, `TF_BUILD`, `TEAMCITY_VERSION` set to a truthy value). The
  CI auto-disable can be overridden with `MACPARAKEET_TELEMETRY=1` for
  developers smoke-testing telemetry from a CI shell. `MACPARAKEET_TELEMETRY=0`
  remains the explicit per-process kill switch.

### Fixed

- Applied the `--json` failure-envelope contract consistently across read-only
  CLI surfaces such as history, stats, prompts, calendar, flow vocabulary, and
  model status.
- `prompts run --json` now emits a single JSON object even when saving the
  generated `PromptResult` fails.
- CLI deletion now removes app-owned dictation audio, YouTube audio, and
  meeting recording folders before deleting their database rows. If managed
  audio cleanup fails, deletion fails visibly instead of leaving app-owned
  audio behind silently.
- Local transcription and export output paths now expand `~`; export also
  creates parent directories and sanitizes default file names.
- App-bundled CLI installs now include a signed `yt-dlp` helper seed. YouTube
  transcription seeds the managed App Support helper from the bundle before
  falling back to network install, while `health --json` remains non-mutating
  and `health --repair-binaries` explicitly fetches the latest helper.

## [1.3.0] -- 2026-04-26

### Added

- `transcribe` accepts `--engine parakeet|whisper` (default `parakeet`) and
  `--language <code>` for Whisper language hints. The `--engine` flag is
  per-invocation and does not mutate the GUI's Speech Recognition setting.
- `transcribe --format json` may include an optional top-level `language`
  field on successful output when the active engine detects or confirms a
  language. This is additive; existing fields and defaults are unchanged.
- `models download <variant>` recognizes Whisper model identifiers such as
  `whisper-large-v3-v20240930-turbo-632MB` and stores them under MacParakeet's
  Whisper model cache.
- `meetings` command namespace for deterministic, local meeting objects:
  `meetings list`, `meetings show`, `meetings transcript`,
  `meetings notes get|set|append|clear`, and `meetings export`.
  These commands expose meeting recordings without requiring any LLM provider:
  metadata, notes, transcript text, timestamp formats, and Markdown/JSON
  exports are all local database reads/writes.
- `transcribe` now initializes the shared telemetry client and emits a
  privacy-safe `cli_operation` product-health event after execution. This does
  not change stdout, stderr, JSON schemas, or exit codes; it follows the GUI
  telemetry preference and the CLI opt-out controls documented above.

### Fixed

- `prompts run` now renders `{{userNotes}}` and `{{transcript}}` with the same
  prompt assembly path used by the GUI, and stores `userNotesSnapshot` on saved
  prompt results. This restores GUI/CLI parity for notes-steered meeting
  prompts while keeping LLM invocation explicitly under `prompts`.
- Meeting retranscription now preserves durable user-authored meeting notes.
- `health --json` is now a non-mutating readiness probe for helper binaries:
  it reports whether `yt-dlp` is installed without downloading or updating it.
  Use `health --repair-binaries` to explicitly install/update helper binaries.
- UUID prefix lookup now enforces the documented minimum prefix length of
  four characters before matching database records by ID prefix.

## [1.2.0] -- 2026-04-26

### Added

- `--json` output mode for the LLM commands (`llm summarize`, `llm chat`,
  `llm transform`, `prompts run`) and `llm test-connection`. Emits a
  structured envelope so agents can read `{output, provider, model,
  usage: {promptTokens, completionTokens, totalTokens}, stopReason,
  latencyMs}` directly rather than regexing prose. Token field names
  match the OpenAI convention. `usage` is omitted when the provider
  doesn't surface it (`localCLI`; some `openaiCompatible` servers).
  `stopReason` is pass-through — provider-native vocabulary
  (`end_turn`, `length`, `STOP`, `done_reason`, etc.) is surfaced
  verbatim. `test-connection --json` returns
  `{ok: true, provider, model, latencyMs}` on success and the standard
  `--json` failure envelope (see top of file) on failure. All `--json`
  commands now share that failure envelope so downstream agents see one
  of two shapes — never a mix of JSON success and plain-text failure.

### Not yet supported

- `--json` combined with `--stream` is rejected at argument validation
  with a clear error. NDJSON streaming (`{type: "delta"}` lines
  followed by a `{type: "final"}` envelope) is a planned follow-up.

## [1.1.0] -- 2026-04-26

### Added

- `flow process --database <path>` can now run the clean text-processing
  pipeline against an explicit SQLite database, matching the testability and
  agent-workflow override already used by other `flow` commands.

### Fixed

- `feedback` and direct `llm` commands now write validation and provider
  errors to stderr instead of stdout.
- `transcribe --format` now rejects unsupported values during argument parsing
  instead of silently falling back to text output.
- `transcribe` now awaits STT runtime shutdown on both success and error paths.

## [1.0.1] -- 2026-04-26

End-to-end validation of the brew-installed 1.0.0 binary surfaced a
single stdout-pollution bug in `transcribe`. Fixed below; no other
behavior change.

### Fixed

- `transcribe --format json` emitted a `Transcribing <file>...` (or
  `Converting`/`Downloading`/`Identifying speakers`/`Finalizing` for
  YouTube URLs) progress line on **stdout** before the JSON payload,
  which broke `transcribe ... --format json | jq .` for any scripted
  caller. Progress messages now go to stderr (matching the existing
  pattern in `prompts run` and the documented "JSON only to stdout"
  contract from `integrations/README.md`). New `printErr(_:)` helper
  in `CLIHelpers.swift` codifies the channel.

### Compatibility notes

- The progress messages are still emitted; they just go to stderr now.
  Human callers using the human-readable `--format txt` (default) are
  unaffected — stderr still surfaces in the terminal.
- Scripted callers that were relying on the progress message appearing
  on stdout (unlikely; it was a polling-style "..." line) need to read
  stderr instead.

## [1.0.0] -- 2026-04-25

First release of the CLI as a versioned public surface. The CLI has existed
since v0.1 of the MacParakeet app and powered AI-assisted testing through
v0.4--v0.6. With the prompts subcommand and JSON sweep landing in
[PR #138](https://github.com/moona3k/macparakeet/pull/138), the surface is
complete enough to commit to. This release marks that commitment.

### Added

- `prompts` subcommand: `list` / `show` / `add` / `set` / `delete` /
  `restore-defaults` / `run`. UUID-or-name lookup with prefix matching, error
  surfacing for ambiguous prefixes, refusal to delete built-ins. `prompts run`
  invokes any LLM provider configured via `--provider --api-key --model`.
  ([PR #138](https://github.com/moona3k/macparakeet/pull/138))
- `--json` flag on read-only commands: `history dictations`,
  `history transcriptions`, `history search`, `history search-transcriptions`,
  `history favorites`, `stats`, `flow words list`, `flow snippets list`,
  `health`, `models status`. Convention: ISO-8601 datetimes, pretty-printed
  output, sorted keys, top-level array for list commands and object for
  single-record / status commands. Matches the existing `calendar upcoming
  --json` shape.
  ([PR #138](https://github.com/moona3k/macparakeet/pull/138))
- `flow words list --source manual|learned|all` filter. Default `all`.
  Surfaces the source distinction (user-typed vs vocabulary-learned) that the
  schema has carried for two releases but the CLI hadn't exposed.
  ([PR #138](https://github.com/moona3k/macparakeet/pull/138))

### Changed

- Command abstract reframed from "internal developer CLI" to a public surface.
  The CLI is now positioned as the canonical Swift-native interface to
  Parakeet TDT on Apple Silicon, with the macOS app as one consumer of it.
  Strategic context: `plans/active/cli-as-canonical-parakeet-surface.md`.

### Compatibility notes

- Pre-1.0 callers are unaffected. Every existing command and flag retains its
  prior behavior; the version bump signals "stability commitment going
  forward," not a breaking-change cliff.
- The CLI ships inside the `MacParakeet.app` bundle today
  (`MacParakeet.app/Contents/MacOS/macparakeet-cli`). Standalone install via
  Homebrew tap is on the roadmap (see plan above) and will not change command
  semantics.
- **`--format json` (transcribe, export) vs `--json` (read-only queries)**
  is deliberate, not a bug. `transcribe` and `export` carry a `--format`
  selector because they emit one of several formats (`transcribe`: text / json;
  `export`: txt / markdown / srt / vtt / json); `--json` on read-only query commands is a binary flag because
  their output shape is conceptually fixed -- it's either JSON or human.
  Unifying this would be a major-version breaking change; we are not doing
  that in 1.0.
