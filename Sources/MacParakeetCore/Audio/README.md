## Entry point

`SharedMicrophoneStream` — the process-wide microphone source. Every
consumer (dictation, meeting mic) calls
`subscribe(wantsVPIO:blocksVPIOPromotion:onEngineDeath:handler:)`
and receives every buffer. The stream owns engine lifecycle, VPIO
arbitration, and fan-out. There is exactly one instance per process,
owned by `AppEnvironment`.

## What's here

**Shared mic engine (the core of this folder)**
- `SharedMicrophoneStream.swift` — fan-out, VPIO state machine,
  subscriber tokens, `Diagnostics` snapshot. ADR-015 + ADR-016.
- `MicrophoneEnginePlatform.swift` — `AVAudioEngine` wrapper. Device
  fallback chain, VPIO toggle, tap install, engine recreation on
  every teardown (so coreaudiod releases the VPAU aggregate
  device), `AVAudioEngineConfigurationChangeNotification` observer.

**Mic consumers (each subscribes to the shared stream)**
- `AudioRecorder.swift` — dictation capture.
  `subscribe(wantsVPIO: false)`. Writes 16 kHz mono Float32 WAVs to
  `$TMPDIR/macparakeet/`. VPIO buffers use channel 0; raw multichannel
  device buffers are downmixed to mono. Owns the dictation diagnostic timers
  (first-buffer watchdog + recording heartbeat). Optional Instant
  Dictation keeps a passive warm subscriber attached while idle,
  stores a 1-second RAM-only 16 kHz mono ring buffer, and prepends up
  to 0.45 seconds when the user starts dictation. It does not run STT
  while idle. When the Pause Media round-trip confirms media was
  playing at press time, `discardPreRollForActiveRecording()` marks
  the session and `stop()` trims the prepended pre-roll from the WAV —
  pre-press media audio that no pause can silence (issue #474).
- `MicrophoneCapture.swift` — meeting microphone capture. Subscribes
  with `wantsVPIO: false` by default via `MeetingMicProcessingMode.raw`.
  VPIO modes remain available for explicit experiments, with raw fallback
  when `.vpioPreferred` cannot engage. Has its own silent-buffer watchdog
  with a stall observer wired up to the meeting flow.

**Meeting-side audio (independent of the mic stream)**
- `SystemAudioStream.swift` — meeting system audio via
  `ScreenCaptureKit` (`SCStream`). Independent of the
  `AVAudioEngine`. Has its own first-buffer watchdog.
- `MeetingAudioCaptureService.swift` — composes mic + system audio
  for meeting recording.
- `MeetingAudioStorageWriter.swift` — fragmented MP4 writer for
  meeting source files (ADR-019 crash recovery).
- `MeetingAudioError.swift`, `MeetingMicProcessingMode.swift` —
  value types.

**Helpers**
- `AudioCaptureDiagnostics.swift` — public `append(_:)` to
  `~/Library/Logs/MacParakeet/dictation-audio.log`. 5 MB cap;
  delete-on-overflow (not rotated). Used by every file in this
  folder, by `AppDelegate`'s boot marker, and by the dictation
  media-pause path (`SystemMediaController` +
  `DictationMediaPauseCoordinator` mirror their `media_pause_*` /
  `media_resume_*` outcomes here so uploaded logs show the
  press→pause window next to the capture timeline; issue #474).
- `DiagnosticLogScope.swift` — `AudioCaptureDiagnostics.scopedLogForUpload`
  trims the log to a recent window (`.recent`, the feedback default:
  last 7 days, 2 MB / 20k-line safety ceilings, min-tail fallback) or
  the whole file (`.full`, advanced opt-in) before a feedback upload.
  Scopes whole lines by recency; never edits line contents.
- `AudioChunker.swift` — actor that buffers resampled audio for
  incremental STT (live meeting transcription).
- `MeetingLiveAudioChunking.swift`,
  `SpeechBoundaryMeetingLiveAudioChunker.swift`,
  `MeetingVADChunkingSimulator.swift` — meeting live-preview chunking
  strategies. The fixed adapter preserves the original 5s / 1s-overlap
  cadence; the VAD strategy cuts cached-model Parakeet sessions at
  speech boundaries and falls back to fixed on VAD errors.
- `AudioFileConverter.swift` — file-side converter (FFmpeg /
  AVFoundation) for file/YouTube/meeting transcription inputs.
- `AudioProcessor.swift` + `AudioProcessorProtocol.swift` — thin
  facade composing `AudioRecorder` + `AudioFileConverter` behind a
  single protocol. Useful where a caller wants both the dictation
  and file-conversion entry points behind one injection seam.
- `AudioDeviceManager.swift` — Core Audio HAL helpers (default
  device, set input on engine, list devices).
- `extractChannelZero`, `microphoneCaptureMonoBuffer` (in `AudioRecorder.swift`),
  `CMSampleBufferToPCMBuffer.swift`, `PCMBufferToSampleBuffer.swift`,
  `UncheckedSendableAudioPCMBuffer.swift`,
  `ObjCExceptionBridge.swift` — pure utilities.

## What to know before editing

**VPIO is sticky once engaged (process-wide).** Once any subscriber
requests VPIO, it stays on for the engine's lifetime. The state
machine in `SharedMicrophoneStream.decideSubscribeAction` enforces
this. Don't try to disengage VPIO mid-session — coreaudiod attaches
the VPAU aggregate device to the **process**, and toggling VPIO mid-
flight changes the input format under live subscribers.

**Passive warm subscribers do not block VPIO promotion.** User-visible
raw capture sessions (`AudioRecorder` active dictation and
`MicrophoneCapture` raw meeting mic) keep `blocksVPIOPromotion=true`
so an explicit VPIO request is deferred until they leave. The Instant
Dictation warm/pre-roll lease passes `blocksVPIOPromotion=false`: it
may keep the shared engine running while idle, but it is not a
recording session and must not prevent a meeting experiment from
promoting the process-wide engine to VPIO.

**Channel 0 mono extraction is mandatory when VPIO is engaged.** VPIO
exposes a duplex layout (typically `ch=9`) where only ch[0] is the
post-AEC processed mono and the rest are reference channels. Use
`extractChannelZero(from:)` — never let `AVAudioConverter`'s default
channel reduction average across them. This was the bug PR #189
fixed; do not regress it.

**Raw multichannel device input is different from VPIO.** Interfaces such as
USB audio boxes may expose several unrelated input channels, and the user's
active microphone can live on channel 2+. Raw capture paths should use
`microphoneCaptureMonoBuffer(from:extractVPIOChannelZero:)`, which downmixes
raw multichannel buffers but still preserves the VPIO channel-0 rule.

**The `AVAudioEngine` is recreated on every teardown.** `tearDownLocked`
in `MicrophoneEnginePlatform` does `audioEngine = AVAudioEngine()`
deliberately. Releasing the old instance triggers coreaudiod to drop
the VPAU aggregate device. Long-lived engines inherit duplex layout
into sibling engines in the same process — exactly the bug PR #189
fixed. Do not optimize this away by caching the engine.

**Tap closures run on the audio render thread.** No allocation, no
actor hops, no `await`. State touched from the tap path uses
`OSAllocatedUnfairLock`-protected nonisolated fields. The buffer
passed in is valid only for the synchronous duration of the call —
copy via `copyPCMBufferForAsyncUse` before retaining or dispatching
async.

**Warm pre-roll is in-memory only.** Instant Dictation's idle audio is
bounded to the private ring in `AudioRecorder`, cleared when recording
starts/stops, when the setting is disabled, and when the warm engine
dies. The only persisted audio remains the normal dictation WAV after
the user starts dictation.

**Diagnostic logging is observability-only.** The first-buffer
watchdog and recording heartbeat in `AudioRecorder` log to
`dictation-audio.log` but **never** abort the recording. PR #210
shipped this deliberately; converting any of those signals into a
user-facing error would mask a regression as a fact of life.
Telemetry counters can be added separately, but the log path stays
non-disruptive.

`MicrophoneEnginePlatform` also logs per-phase engine-start timings
(`shared_mic_engine_start_timing`) so a slow first-buffer report can be split
between device setting, VPIO toggling, input format lookup, tap install, and
`AVAudioEngine.start()`.

**First-buffer can arrive before timers are armed.** When subscribing
from an actor, the AVAudioEngine tap can fire its first buffer
during the `await sharedStream.subscribe(...)` suspension, before
post-await `armCaptureDiagnostics` runs. State that tracks "have we
seen the first buffer yet" must be generation-keyed (see
`firstBufferSeenGeneration` in `AudioRecorder`) and the arming code
must check it before scheduling the watchdog. Bool flags get reset
on arm and lose the early buffer.

**Concurrent dictation and meeting recording is supported (ADR-015).**
A user can dictate while a meeting recording is active. Both flows
fan out from the same `SharedMicrophoneStream` instance. Don't add
state that assumes a single consumer at a time.

**System audio is a separate stream.** `SystemAudioStream` uses
`ScreenCaptureKit`, not `AVAudioEngine`. It does not share lifecycle,
VPIO state, or the fan-out path with the mic stream. Meeting
recording composes both via `MeetingAudioCaptureService`.

**The diagnostic log file is shared across processes.** Both the dev
app and `swift test` write to
`~/Library/Logs/MacParakeet/dictation-audio.log`. The
`dictation_diagnostics_session_start` line emitted by `AppDelegate`
on launch is the only reliable per-process separator. The 5 MB cap
deletes the file when crossed (no rotation); a heavy user retains
tens of days of context.

## How to verify a change

- `swift test --filter Audio` — covers the shared stream's state
  machine, the platform adapter, the recorder, and the diagnostic
  helpers under deterministic mocks.
- `swift test --filter SharedMicrophoneStream` — the VPIO state
  machine specifically.
- `swift test` — full suite (~100 s). Audio changes ripple into
  dictation, meeting, and STT scheduler tests.
- Dev-app smoke (the canonical happy-path check):
  1. `scripts/dev/run_app.sh`.
  2. Dictate three times in sequence.
  3. Start a meeting recording.
  4. Dictate during the meeting.
  5. Stop the meeting; dictate once more.
  6. Inspect `~/Library/Logs/MacParakeet/dictation-audio.log` —
     expect clean `engine_started → first_buffer → heartbeat → stop`
     cycles for each dictation and a clean
     `meeting_mic_capture_started → meeting_mic_first_buffer →
     meeting_mic_capture_stopped` cycle for the meeting.
- After a stall report: cross-reference the user's log against the
  decision tree in PR #210's description.
