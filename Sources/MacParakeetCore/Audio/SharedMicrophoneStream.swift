/// Single mic engine shared across dictation and meeting recording.
///
/// Completed plan: `plans/completed/shared-mic-engine.md`.
/// The real-world bug this addresses: enabling VPIO anywhere in the process
/// makes coreaudiod hand every other `AVAudioEngine` a multi-channel duplex
/// layout. Two independent engines look isolated in code but aren't isolated
/// at the kernel layer. One shared engine with explicit VPIO arbitration
/// removes the ambiguity.
///
/// ## Design pillars
///
/// 1. **One mic engine per process.** Enforced by living in `AppEnvironment`
///    as a singleton. Multiple instances reproduce the original bug shape.
///
/// 2. **One serialization point for state + engine ops.** Subscribe and
///    unsubscribe dispatch onto a private serial `engineQueue`. State
///    mutation, engine action, and rollback all run within a single queue
///    task — there is no window where a second subscribe can observe an
///    optimistic state mid-failure. The state lock remains for cross-thread
///    reads (render thread, accessor methods) but never gates serialization.
///
/// 3. **Lock-free fan-out via cached snapshot.** Every state change
///    refreshes a precomputed `[BufferHandler]` snapshot. The render thread
///    reads it under `OSAllocatedUnfairLock` and releases before invoking
///    handlers. Reading the snapshot is a refcount-inc on Array's COW
///    buffer — bounded, no heap allocation, render-thread-safe.
///
/// 4. **VPIO is sticky once engaged.** Once any subscriber requests VPIO,
///    it stays on for the engine's lifetime. Disengaging mid-session would
///    require another stop+start dance with no user-visible benefit.
///
/// 5. **VPIO engagement is deferred** if an active non-VPIO subscriber is in
///    flight. Avoids a format-change in the middle of an active dictation
///    stream. Passive warm subscribers keep the engine alive but do not block
///    VPIO promotion because they are not user-visible recording sessions.
///    The deferral counter is exposed for telemetry sizing.
///
/// 6. **Subscribers receive a read-only buffer** valid only for the
///    synchronous handler call. Retention or mutation requires copying
///    first; the engine may reuse the underlying memory immediately after
///    return.
///
/// 7. **Engine death is observable.** When a deferred-VPIO promotion's
///    `tearDown → setVoiceProcessingEnabled → start` sequence fails, the
///    engine is left stopped. `diagnostics.engineRunning` reflects this,
///    remaining subscriptions are invalidated, and each captured
///    `onEngineDeath` callback fires (off-lock, off the engine queue) so
///    consumers can surface a stall to the user instead of silently going
///    quiet.
