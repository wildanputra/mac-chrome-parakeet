# STT

> One process-wide speech-to-text control plane. Parakeet (FluidAudio /
> CoreML) is default, with v3 multilingual as the default build, v2
> English-only and Parakeet Unified (English-only, punctuated offline output
> plus native live dictation partials)
> as opt-in Parakeet variants; Nemotron is an opt-in Beta
> engine with two builds — multilingual (Nemotron 3.5, default) and an
> English-only streaming build (Nemotron Speech Streaming EN 0.6B);
> WhisperKit is optional for languages outside Parakeet/Nemotron
> coverage.

## Entry point

`STTScheduler` — the public actor every feature submits work to.
Owns slot assignment, queueing, priority, backpressure, cancellation,
and progress fan-out. App code reaches it as
`AppEnvironment.sttScheduler`. The scheduler delegates model lifecycle
to one `STTRuntime`; callers do not own model lifecycles directly.

## What's here

**Speech control plane**
- `STTScheduler.swift` — public broker. Job admission, slot scheduling,
  engine routing, session leases for active meetings.
- `STTRuntime.swift` — sole owner of the Parakeet TDT `AsrManager`s, the
  optional `ParakeetUnifiedEngine` (routed when the persisted
  `ParakeetModelVariant` is `.unified`), the optional Beta
  `NemotronEngine`/`NemotronEnglishEngine` pair (routed by the persisted
  `NemotronModelVariant`), and the optional `WhisperEngine`. Handles warm-up,
  model init, cache clearing, shutdown, and Parakeet/Nemotron build swaps.
- `STTClient.swift` + `STTClientProtocol.swift` — **CLI / test
  facade only**. Each `STTClient` instantiates its own runtime and
  scheduler, bypassing the process singleton. App code must use the
  shared scheduler from `AppEnvironment`.
- `STTResult.swift` — value type returned by every transcribe call
  (text, word-level timing, optional detected language, the engine
  that produced the result, and an optional engine-specific model
  variant).
- `ParakeetUnifiedEngine.swift` — FluidAudio `UnifiedAsrManager` +
  `StreamingUnifiedAsrManager` wrapper for NVIDIA Parakeet Unified EN 0.6B
  (English-only, int8). Selected when `ParakeetModelVariant == .unified`.
  File, meeting, and recorded-file dictation use FluidAudio's overlapping 15 s
  offline batch transcription (`parakeet-unified-offline-15s`) because that is
  the best stop-time quality path. Live dictation uses the native low-latency
  streaming build (`parakeet-unified-2080ms`) to emit partials while capture is
  active. No word timings; `language` fixed to `en`.
- `WhisperEngine.swift` — WhisperKit wrapper conforming to the same
  shape as the Parakeet path.
- `NemotronEngine.swift` — FluidAudio Nemotron 3.5 wrapper for the
  Beta local multilingual engine. Uses separate interactive/background
  managers backed by shared model weights so it fits the scheduler lanes.
  Preserves FluidAudio token timings as MacParakeet word timestamps when
  available.
- `NemotronEnglishEngine.swift` — FluidAudio Nemotron Speech Streaming
  EN 0.6B wrapper (English-only Beta build, `english-1120ms`). Same
  two-lane shape; no language hints, no shared-weights API (both lanes
  load the same compiled artifacts). File/meeting jobs feed batch-at-stop
  through the streaming manager in bounded slices; live dictation drives
  the same manager incrementally and emits partials (see below). Preserves
  FluidAudio token timings as MacParakeet word timestamps when available.
- `NativeLiveDictating.swift` — internal protocol the native streaming engines
  conform to so `STTRuntime` can route a live dictation session to the active
  Nemotron or Parakeet Unified build without knowing the concrete engine type.

**Hotkey state (lives here for testability)**
- `FnKeyStateMachine.swift` — pure state machine for legacy combined
  dictation gestures and shared timing constants.
- `HotkeyGestureController.swift` — wraps the state machine for the
  app's hotkey driver and scopes behavior to combined, hands-free-only,
  or push-to-talk-only roles.
- `HotkeyTrigger.swift` — value types describing trigger kinds.
- `KeyCodeNames.swift` — display strings for keys, plus the
  function-family classification used to tell a genuinely held Fn
  modifier from the phantom `.function` flag macOS sets on F-key,
  arrow, and nav-cluster presses.
- `OnboardingProgressParser.swift` — parses FluidAudio model-download
  progress lines for the onboarding UI.

These hotkey/onboarding files live in `STT/` because they were
originally tied to the dictation start path and need to be in
`MacParakeetCore` for cross-target test access. Folder naming is a
minor historical wart, not a design statement.

## Cross-references

- ADR-001 — Parakeet TDT 0.6B-v3 as primary/default STT, amended to expose
  v2 English-only as an opt-in Parakeet build.
- ADR-007 — FluidAudio CoreML migration; Parakeet runs on the Apple
  Neural Engine via CoreML.
- ADR-016 — centralized STT runtime + 2-slot scheduler; this folder
  is the implementation.
- ADR-021 — WhisperKit as optional multilingual engine; engine
  routing and meeting engine leases live in `STTScheduler`.
- ADR-009 — custom hotkey support (relevant to the hotkey files
  above).
- `spec/06-stt-engine.md` — narrative spec.
- Audio buffers feeding the scheduler: `../Audio/`.

## What to know before editing

**One scheduler per process.** ADR-016 is non-negotiable. App code
gets `STTScheduler` from `AppEnvironment`. Never instantiate
`STTRuntime`, `STTScheduler`, or `STTClient` from a feature service
— that fragments the control plane and breaks admission control.
The lone exception is `STTClient`, which is intentionally
self-contained for the CLI and tests.

**Two execution slots, four job classes.** The scheduler exposes
`dictation`, `meetingFinalize`, `meetingLiveChunk`, and
`fileTranscription`. Dictation has its own reserved slot so
interactive latency is preserved. The other three share a
background slot, with explicit priority: meeting finalize
> meeting live chunk > file transcription. Backpressure on the
shared slot drops the lowest-priority pending work.

**Meeting stop does not create a second ASR lane.** Back-to-back meeting
recording is implemented by returning the recorder to idle after the stopped
meeting's audio files, `awaitingTranscription` lock, and processing Library row
are durable. The queued final STT still enters the shared background slot as
`meetingFinalize`. If a file, folder, YouTube, podcast, or media URL
transcription is already running, it is not preempted; the stopped meeting
waits for that job to finish. Once the slot is free, `meetingFinalize` outranks
queued `fileTranscription` work. URL download and metadata extraction do not
occupy STT; only the post-download transcription job does.

**Native live dictation sessions (Nemotron and Parakeet Unified).** When the
selected engine is Nemotron — either build, multilingual or English-only — or
Parakeet with the `.unified` variant, dictation can hold a live streaming
session via `beginLiveDictationTranscription` / `appendLiveDictationSamples` /
`finishLiveDictationTranscription` / `cancelLiveDictationTranscription`. The
runtime routes the session to the active native streaming build through
`NativeLiveDictating`.
The session owns the interactive slot for its duration: competing
dictation transcribe jobs are rejected with `engineBusy`, engine-switch
availability reports `transcribing`, and quiesce/shutdown cancels the
session (or waits out an in-flight finish). Meeting live chunks and
finalize are unaffected — they stay on the background slot.
`DictationService` always records the WAV alongside the live stream and uses
recorded-file transcription for the final paste/history result. Native live
partials remain display-only; if the live stream fails, drops samples, or
finishes empty, only the preview is degraded.

**Display-only dictation preview (Parakeet/Whisper-capable path).**
Dictation can request a single-flight tail-window preview via
`transcribeDictationPreview`. This does not reserve a scheduler slot and
does not replace the recorded-file final transcript; it is only for the
floating overlay text while capture is active. Parakeet v2/v3 use this
tail-window batch preview; Parakeet Unified and Nemotron use native streaming
partials instead, and Whisper remains default-off. Engine switches, variant
switches, and dictation stop/cancel paths cancel the preview with bounded drain.
If a cancelled preview still has runtime work in flight, engine/variant switches
fail fast with `engineBusy` rather than reloading under active inference; the
final paste path still proceeds after its bounded display-preview drain. Runtime
quiesce paths such as shutdown and cache clear wait for preview drain under the
unhealthy-runtime watchdog before unloading or clearing model state.

**Engine routing is per-job.** Parakeet stays default. The selected Parakeet
build is `v3` unless the user opts into `v2` through Settings or the CLI
(`config set parakeet-model`, `models select parakeet-v2`, or
`transcribe --parakeet-model v2`). A subscriber can request Nemotron or
WhisperKit globally (Settings / `models select`) or per call (CLI
`--engine nemotron --language ko`, `--engine whisper --language ko`). When set
globally, dictation also routes there; when set per-job, only that job uses the
requested engine.

**Active meetings hold an engine lease.** Once a meeting recording
starts, its engine selection is captured for the session's duration.
Engine switching is blocked while the lease is held — switching
mid-meeting would split a single recording across two engines'
output formats, which the transcript assembler does not support.
The lease releases when the meeting stops or recovery completes.

**Model lifecycle is the runtime's job, not yours.** Don't call
`AsrManager` directly from app code, don't `Task { try await
manager.initialize() }`, and don't reach into `STTRuntime`'s
private state. Warm-up happens automatically (background or
explicit); use `STTRuntime.observeWarmUpProgress()` to surface UI.

**Hotkey state is pure and testable.** `FnKeyStateMachine` and
`HotkeyGestureController` take abstract gesture events with timestamps
and emit actions. Don't add CGEvent or NSEvent imports here — that
machinery lives in the GUI target's `Hotkey/` folder and translates
real events into the controller's input shape.

## How to verify a change

- `swift test --filter STT` — scheduler, runtime, slot ordering,
  backpressure, engine routing, lease semantics.
- `swift test --filter FnKeyStateMachine` — gesture state machine.
- `swift test` — full suite (~100 s). STT changes ripple through
  dictation and meeting recording tests.
- Manual: dev-app smoke covering all four job classes — dictate
  during a file transcription (file work should yield to
  dictation), start a meeting and dictate during it, kick off a
  long file transcription and confirm cancellation works mid-job.
- For engine routing: run the CLI
  `swift run macparakeet-cli transcribe --engine nemotron --language ja
  /path/to/japanese.m4a` and
  `swift run macparakeet-cli transcribe --engine whisper --language ja
  /path/to/japanese.m4a`, then confirm the requested engine is used.
