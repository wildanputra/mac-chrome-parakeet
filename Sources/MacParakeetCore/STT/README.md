# STT

> One process-wide speech-to-text control plane. Parakeet (FluidAudio /
> CoreML) is default, with v3 multilingual as the default build and v2
> English-only as an opt-in Parakeet variant; Nemotron is an opt-in Beta
> engine with two builds — multilingual (Nemotron 3.5, default) and an
> English-only streaming build (Nemotron Speech Streaming EN 0.6B);
> WhisperKit is optional for languages outside Parakeet/Nemotron
> coverage.

## Entry point

`STTScheduler` — the public actor every feature submits work to.
Owns slot assignment, queueing, priority, backpressure, cancellation,
and progress fan-out. App code reaches it as
`AppEnvironment.sttScheduler`. The scheduler delegates model lifecycle
to one `STTRuntime`; callers do not own model lifecycles directly.

## What's here

**Speech control plane**
- `STTScheduler.swift` — public broker. Job admission, slot scheduling,
  engine routing, session leases for active meetings.
- `STTRuntime.swift` — sole owner of the Parakeet `AsrManager`s, the
  optional Beta `NemotronEngine`/`NemotronEnglishEngine` pair (routed
  by the persisted `NemotronModelVariant`), and the optional
  `WhisperEngine`. Handles warm-up, model init, cache clearing,
  shutdown, and Parakeet/Nemotron build swaps.
- `STTClient.swift` + `STTClientProtocol.swift` — **CLI / test
  facade only**. Each `STTClient` instantiates its own runtime and
  scheduler, bypassing the process singleton. App code must use the
  shared scheduler from `AppEnvironment`.
- `STTResult.swift` — value type returned by every transcribe call
  (text, word-level timing, optional detected language, the engine
  that produced the result, and an optional engine-specific model
  variant).
- `WhisperEngine.swift` — WhisperKit wrapper conforming to the same
  shape as the Parakeet path.
- `NemotronEngine.swift` — FluidAudio Nemotron 3.5 wrapper for the
  Beta local multilingual engine. Uses separate interactive/background
  managers backed by shared model weights so it fits the scheduler lanes.
- `NemotronEnglishEngine.swift` — FluidAudio Nemotron Speech Streaming
  EN 0.6B wrapper (English-only Beta build, `english-1120ms`). Same
  two-lane shape; no language hints, no shared-weights API (both lanes
  load the same compiled artifacts), batch-at-stop feeding through the
  streaming manager in bounded slices.

**Hotkey state (lives here for testability)**
- `FnKeyStateMachine.swift` — pure state machine for legacy combined
  dictation gestures and shared timing constants.
- `HotkeyGestureController.swift` — wraps the state machine for the
  app's hotkey driver and scopes behavior to combined, hands-free-only,
  or push-to-talk-only roles.
- `HotkeyTrigger.swift` — value types describing trigger kinds.
- `KeyCodeNames.swift` — display strings for keys, plus the
  function-family classification used to tell a genuinely held Fn
  modifier from the phantom `.function` flag macOS sets on F-key,
  arrow, and nav-cluster presses.
- `OnboardingProgressParser.swift` — parses FluidAudio model-download
  progress lines for the onboarding UI.

These hotkey/onboarding files live in `STT/` because they were
originally tied to the dictation start path and need to be in
`MacParakeetCore` for cross-target test access. Folder naming is a
minor historical wart, not a design statement.

## Cross-references

- ADR-001 — Parakeet TDT 0.6B-v3 as primary/default STT, amended to expose
  v2 English-only as an opt-in Parakeet build.
- ADR-007 — FluidAudio CoreML migration; Parakeet runs on the Apple
  Neural Engine via CoreML.
- ADR-016 — centralized STT runtime + 2-slot scheduler; this folder
  is the implementation.
- ADR-021 — WhisperKit as optional multilingual engine; engine
  routing and meeting engine leases live in `STTScheduler`.
- ADR-009 — custom hotkey support (relevant to the hotkey files
  above).
- `spec/06-stt-engine.md` — narrative spec.
- Audio buffers feeding the scheduler: `../Audio/`.

## What to know before editing

**One scheduler per process.** ADR-016 is non-negotiable. App code
gets `STTScheduler` from `AppEnvironment`. Never instantiate
`STTRuntime`, `STTScheduler`, or `STTClient` from a feature service
— that fragments the control plane and breaks admission control.
The lone exception is `STTClient`, which is intentionally
self-contained for the CLI and tests.

**Two execution slots, four job classes.** The scheduler exposes
`dictation`, `meetingFinalize`, `meetingLiveChunk`, and
`fileTranscription`. Dictation has its own reserved slot so
interactive latency is preserved. The other three share a
background slot, with explicit priority: meeting finalize
> meeting live chunk > file transcription. Backpressure on the
shared slot drops the lowest-priority pending work.

**Live dictation sessions (Nemotron only).** When the selected engine
is Nemotron, dictation can hold a live streaming session via
`beginLiveDictationTranscription` / `appendLiveDictationSamples` /
`finishLiveDictationTranscription` / `cancelLiveDictationTranscription`.
The session owns the interactive slot for its duration: competing
dictation transcribe jobs are rejected with `engineBusy`, engine-switch
availability reports `transcribing`, and quiesce/shutdown cancels the
session (or waits out an in-flight finish). Meeting live chunks and
finalize are unaffected — they stay on the background slot.
`DictationService` always records the WAV alongside the live stream and
falls back to recorded-file transcription if the live session fails,
drops samples, or finishes empty.

**Engine routing is per-job.** Parakeet stays default. The selected Parakeet
build is `v3` unless the user opts into `v2` through Settings or the CLI
(`config set parakeet-model`, `models select parakeet-v2`, or
`transcribe --parakeet-model v2`). A subscriber can request Nemotron or
WhisperKit globally (Settings / `models select`) or per call (CLI
`--engine nemotron --language ko`, `--engine whisper --language ko`). When set
globally, dictation also routes there; when set per-job, only that job uses the
requested engine.

**Active meetings hold an engine lease.** Once a meeting recording
starts, its engine selection is captured for the session's duration.
Engine switching is blocked while the lease is held — switching
mid-meeting would split a single recording across two engines'
output formats, which the transcript assembler does not support.
The lease releases when the meeting stops or recovery completes.

**Model lifecycle is the runtime's job, not yours.** Don't call
`AsrManager` directly from app code, don't `Task { try await
manager.initialize() }`, and don't reach into `STTRuntime`'s
private state. Warm-up happens automatically (background or
explicit); use `STTRuntime.observeWarmUpProgress()` to surface UI.

**Hotkey state is pure and testable.** `FnKeyStateMachine` and
`HotkeyGestureController` take abstract gesture events with timestamps
and emit actions. Don't add CGEvent or NSEvent imports here — that
machinery lives in the GUI target's `Hotkey/` folder and translates
real events into the controller's input shape.

## How to verify a change

- `swift test --filter STT` — scheduler, runtime, slot ordering,
  backpressure, engine routing, lease semantics.
- `swift test --filter FnKeyStateMachine` — gesture state machine.
- `swift test` — full suite (~100 s). STT changes ripple through
  dictation and meeting recording tests.
- Manual: dev-app smoke covering all four job classes — dictate
  during a file transcription (file work should yield to
  dictation), start a meeting and dictate during it, kick off a
  long file transcription and confirm cancellation works mid-job.
- For engine routing: run the CLI
  `swift run macparakeet-cli transcribe --engine nemotron --language ja
  /path/to/japanese.m4a` and
  `swift run macparakeet-cli transcribe --engine whisper --language ja
  /path/to/japanese.m4a`, then confirm the requested engine is used.
