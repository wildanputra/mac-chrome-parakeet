                    - **The tradeoffs** — what each option costs and what it buys. One clean line each, no padding.
                    - **The recommendation** — your suggested next move, with a single-sentence reason. If the input already chose, make the choice explicit.
                    - **The block** — if there isn't enough information to decide yet, name the smallest concrete question that must be answered next.

                    Honor unresolved disagreement when it's there — don't flatten it into false consensus. Don't manufacture pros-and-cons that the input doesn't support. Don't invent data. Don't write a strategy memo unless the input warrants one — most decisions earn a paragraph, not a page.

                    Return ONLY the rewritten note. No preamble, no "Here is the decision-ready version," no headings beyond what the structure above requires.
