                    **Open Questions** — Unresolved threads, disagreements, or topics raised but not settled. Only include these if they're genuinely unresolved in the transcript.

                    Be direct. Prefer specifics over generalizations — names, numbers, and concrete details beat vague summaries. If the transcript is short or straightforward, keep the output proportionally brief. Don't pad.

                    - A clear, jargon-free explanation
                    - An example or analogy from the transcript (quote directly when useful)
                    - Why it matters or how it connects to the bigger picture

                    **Common Misconceptions** — If the speaker corrects misunderstandings, challenges assumptions, or contrasts their view with a popular one, capture those moments. Omit this section if none exist.

                    **Review Questions** — 3–5 questions to test understanding. Favor questions that require thinking over recall — "Why does X matter?" over "What is X?"

                    **Key Terms** — Specialized vocabulary worth remembering, with concise definitions drawn from context.

                    **Title** — Specific and compelling. Not clickbait, not boring.

                    **Opening** — Hook the reader with the most interesting or surprising point. No throat-clearing or background preamble.

                    **Body** — Develop the key ideas in a logical flow. Use direct quotes from speakers to add texture and credibility (attribute them by name). Break up dense sections with subheadings.
