/// "Notes are user-authored only" is enforced at the type level: `notesText`

/// (which routes through `applyEdit(_:)`), and the only other write paths are
/// `restore(_:)` (called from recovery at launch) and `reset()` (called when
/// the panel is disposed). Adding a programmatic insertion path (e.g. for an
/// "insert AI response into notes" affordance) would require a new public
/// mutator — visible in code review and a deliberate violation of the
/// user-authored-notes invariant. This is what lets every consumer of
/// `userNotes` (the transcription detail page, the `notes.md` sidecar, and
/// the chat path's optional `userNotes` parameter) treat the value as a
/// trustable signal of what the user actually cares about, rather than a
/// blob that AI replies could recursively dilute.
