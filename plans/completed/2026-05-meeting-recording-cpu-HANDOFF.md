## TL;DR

> **Owner correction (2026-05-29):** this was **not a v0.6.14 regression** — the
> meeting animations (and their CPU cost) existed since the feature shipped; it
> was *surfaced* around v0.6.14, not introduced by it. The engineering below
> stands regardless. The "do not re-release until a release-build pass" gate is
> relaxed to "optional confirmation" — the owner is "ok even with the cpu spike
> until someone complains," and the rich pill was verified to add no CPU.

Meeting recording carried a long-standing elevated CPU cost while recording with
the Meetings workspace visible (laggy hover/list). v0.6.14 was pulled from the
appcast as a precaution; public is on 0.6.13.

**Two root causes were found and fixed (verified on-device, debug build):**

1. **Continuous SwiftUI animation in always-resident windows.** `repeatForever` /
   `TimelineView(.animation)` hosted in a resident window does per-frame work on
   the main thread via `NSHostingView` (re-eval `body` → `DisplayList` → CA
   commit, every display refresh). Fixed by moving these to Core Animation
   (`CALayer` + `CABasicAnimation`), which interpolates on the render server at
   ~0 app CPU.
2. **`MeetingsView` re-laying out the whole list every elapsed-second tick** —
   `body` read `meetingPillViewModel.formattedElapsed`, so each 1 s tick
   re-evaluated the entire body incl. the meetings `ForEach` (a `sizeThatFits`
   storm). **This was the actual reported "laggy Meetings workspace while
   recording."** Fixed by isolating the elapsed read into a leaf view.

Key reframe (the owner intuited this and it's correct): **the floating pill was
never the main hog.** The dominant cost was #2 (the workspace). The pill is
~19–21% (mostly capture + VAD). The rosette rotation was *already* CALayer even
in the old pill. It was **CPU/rendering, never memory** (RAM stayed ~0.5%).

## What changed (all committed + pushed on the branch)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `Views/MeetingRecording/MeetingRecordingPanelView.swift` | `BreathingSeedOfLifeView` → `NSViewRepresentable` + CALayer (`BreathingSeedOfLifeNSView`). CA pause for `freeze`; honors Reduce Motion. Fixes all 3 consumers (transcript + live-notes watermark, summary skeleton). |
| `Views/MeetingRecording/MeetingRecordingPillController.swift` | AppKit/CALayer pill + Reduce Motion + compacted capsule 54×106→54×86 + hover-time badge. **+ richness:** dispatches the icon faces (recording/paused/completing/transcribing/completed), shrinks the capsule to a **circle** for the stem-less states, `updateLiveAudioLevel` forwards the fast glow, and `refreshState()` (pushed by the coordinator) makes transitions instant. Badge ticker is a `@MainActor Task` (Swift-6 deinit-clean). |
| `Views/MeetingRecording/MerkabaPillIcon.swift` | CALayer rosette icon. **+ richness:** now owns four lifecycle faces (rosette / collapse merkaba / spinner / checkmark) with `setLiveGlow`, `playCompletion`, `showSpinner`, `showCheckmark`; all honor Reduce Motion. |
| `Views/Transcription/MeetingRecordingTile.swift` | `SacredFlowerTile` dead rotation/sway machinery removed → static rosette. |
| `Views/Meetings/MeetingsView.swift` | **Root cause #2 fix** — `MeetingsLiveStatusChip` leaf view owns the `formattedElapsed` read. |
| `App/AppWindowCoordinator.swift` | (prior WIP) main-window close releases the SwiftUI hosting tree. |
| `App/MeetingRecordingFlowCoordinator.swift` | pill poll 1 s + change-gated + quantized (`displayLevel`). **+ richness:** `startPillGlowPolling()` — a separate ~30 fps CALayer-only audio→glow loop (never touches `@Observable`). |
| `plans/active/assets/2026-05-pill-richness-*.png` | richness proof — `-faces.png` (harness, all faces + glow levels), `-live.png` (real-app lifecycle). |
| `plans/active/2026-05-meeting-recording-cpu-debug.md` | full log + measurements + richness (implemented). |

Commits on the branch (newest first): _(richness commit — see `git log`)_,
`05c25683` (dictation outcome + richness plan), `0bf8f17d` (measurement
coverage), `788a19ad` (#204 regression note), `c2ce04b9` (MeetingsView fix +
hover-time), `57698106` (animation→CA + pill + window).

## Verified on-device (debug build — numbers are inflated vs release)

| Scenario | CPU |
|---|---|
| Idle (no window) | ~0.0–0.5% |
| Recording, pill only — earlier baseline | ~19–21% |
| Recording, **rich pill + 30 fps glow loop** (this session) | **~14–21%, avg ~16–17%** — richness added no CPU |
| Recording, Meetings workspace visible — **before** #2 fix | ~25–46% sustained (the bug) |
| Recording, Meetings workspace visible — **after** #2 fix | ~15–18% (storm gone from `sample` profile) |
| Settled dictation | not measured (deprioritized); prior ~5–11% stands |

`swift build` ✅, `swift test` ✅ (exit 0). PR #204 (issue #200, tooltip wrap
past 99:59) **not regressed** — the new CALayer badge stays single-line at
`114:44`/`999:59` (`isWrapped=false` + width from measured text).

## What's done / not done — next steps

- [x] **Restore the pill's lost richness** (owner explicitly wanted this) — DONE
  in PR #396. Live audio-responsive glow via a pill-local **~30 fps CALayer-only**
  channel (`startPillGlowPolling`, separate from the 1 s `startPillPolling`), plus
  the completion **collapse merkaba → spinner → checkmark** ported to CALayer one-
  shots as four "faces" on `MerkabaPillIconView`. The stem-less states (spinner /
  checkmark) render in a **circular** container that the capsule animates down to.
  Also fixed a latent bug: the coordinator now pushes state via `refreshState()`
  so transitions are instant (the pill previously only polled at 1 s, which a
  visible collapse flourish would have exposed as lag). All faces honor
  `reduceMotion`, and it's Swift-6 language-mode clean (the CI gate). Verified
  ~16–17% recording (debug) — no CPU added. See the debug doc's "Restore the
  pill's lost richness — IMPLEMENTED" section + `plans/active/assets/2026-05-pill-richness-*.png`.
- [ ] **(Optional) Release-build CPU confirmation.** Debug numbers are inflated;
  a Release pass on the final (richness-included) build is confirmation, not a
  blocker (see TL;DR correction). Use the verification matrix in the debug doc.
- [x] **Dictation comparison** — deprioritized by the owner ("no need… doesn't
  need testing rn"); it was never the regression surface.
- [ ] **Delete dead `MeetingRecordingPillView`** (`MeetingRecordingPillView.swift`)
  — its helpers `FlowerCompletionView` + `MeetingCompletionCheckmarkView` were the
  SwiftUI reference for the CALayer port; remove all three together in a small
  follow-up.
- [ ] **CI/lint recurrence guard** — flag `repeatForever` /
  `TimelineView(.animation)` introduced in always-resident window surfaces. 2nd
  occurrence of this class (PR #107 was the 1st).

## Operational notes for the next agent

- **Driving the dev app for measurement** (Accessibility is granted, AppleScript
  works): `scripts/dev/run_app.sh` builds + relaunches (kills old instance,
  non-blocking). Trigger meeting:
  `osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to tell process "MacParakeet" to click menu item "Start Recording" of menu 1 of menu bar item "Capture" of menu bar 1'`
  (toggles to "Stop Recording"). Open workspace: same pattern with
  `"Meetings"` of `"Go"`. "Start Dictation" is also under "Capture".
- **Measure CPU:** `top -l N -s 1 -pid <pid> -stats pid,cpu,command | grep "^<pid>"`
  (skip the 1st sample). `-stats cpu` alone parses unreliably — use the multi-col
  form. `sample <pid> 3 -file /tmp/x.txt` for hot paths.
- **Pill render harness** (preview pill states without launching the app, faithful
  because it compiles the real `MerkabaPillIconView`):
  `plans/active/assets/pill_preview_harness.swift`. Run:
  `swiftc -o /tmp/pillrender plans/active/assets/pill_preview_harness.swift Sources/MacParakeet/Views/MeetingRecording/MerkabaPillIcon.swift && /tmp/pillrender`
  → writes a PNG. Edit the `panels` array to render variants (hover, paused,
  long timestamps). Used to tune the 54×86 compaction + verify the hover badge.
- **⚠️ A meeting recording may still be live on the dev app** (the owner started
  one to test hover). It captures audio — stop via the pill's right-click. Also
  **~2 short test meetings** (~20–30 s) were created during measurement — delete
  from Library → Meetings if unwanted. (Did not auto-delete: never remove meeting
  data without confirmation.)

## Key learnings (worth a memory entry)

- **Never drive a *continuous* animation with SwiftUI (`repeatForever` /
  `TimelineView(.animation)`) in an always-resident window.** It does per-frame
  main-thread work through `NSHostingView`. Use `CALayer` + `CABasicAnimation`
  (render-server interpolation, ~0 app CPU). Transient indicators in SwiftUI are
  fine; resident ones are not.
- **Don't read a fast-ticking `@Observable` value (elapsed timer, audio level)
  high in a `body` that also builds an expensive subtree** (a list). The whole
  subtree re-lays out every tick. Push the read into the smallest leaf view.
- **CALayer makes *rich* animation cheap**, not just static — live glows /
  waveforms via direct layer-property updates cost ~nothing. The old SwiftUI
  pill's cost was the re-render path, not the richness.
- The CALayer pill migration silently dropped two things that were re-added:
  **Reduce Motion** and the **hover-time badge**. When porting SwiftUI→AppKit,
  audit for dropped affordances.
