## 1. Goal & north star

Give MacParakeet a **first-party, on-device LLM** that powers transcript-based AI — **cleanup, summarization, QA, and (later) tool-calling** — with **no API key, no second app, and nothing leaving the Mac**, set up in **one click**.

**North star: output quality/accuracy of the final result.** We target performant Apple Silicon Macs, so model size (multi-GB download/RAM) is acceptable when it buys reliably better output. Latency is a managed secondary concern.

**Strategy: hyper-focus on one engine and one self-optimized model.** Rather than supporting every runtime and every model format, we commit to **MLX** (Apple's on-device ML framework) and ship a **single model that we optimize specifically for Apple Silicon** — an open, permissively-licensed base that we convert, quantize, and (over time) fine-tune for MacParakeet's transcript tasks, with our own purpose-built model as the endgame. This is the opposite of a sprawling provider matrix: one engine, one tuned model, deeply optimized.

This is **not** "bundle a model into the app." The app stays small; the model is an **opt-in, verified download** the user enables with a single action, on top of the BYO flexibility we already have (Ollama / LM Studio / cloud keys / local CLI remain for power users).

### Why this matters now
Today every AI feature requires the user to bring a cloud API key **or** stand up Ollama/LM Studio themselves — a real setup cliff and an extra trust boundary for transcript text. Issue #439 captures it: people want a default local refiner that "just works" for "mama + grandma," while power users keep their options. The same on-device model unlocks summary/QA over meeting, YouTube, and file transcripts with no cloud round-trip.

## 2. Use cases (priority order)

| # | Task | What it needs | Where it plugs in today (provider-agnostic already) |
|---|------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| A | **Transcript / dictation cleanup** (disfluency removal, light formatting, ITN, casing) | Strong instruction-following + faithfulness; low temperature; fast | `TextProcessing/AIFormatter.swift`, `TextProcessing/TranscriptFormatter.swift`; dictation `Services/Dictation/DictationService.swift`, file/URL/meeting `Services/TranscriptionService.swift` |
| B | **Summarization of long transcripts** (meetings, YouTube, files; 10k–50k+ tokens) | Long context (via chunking/map-reduce); capable model | `PromptResultsViewModel` → `LLMService.generatePromptResultStream`; prompt library |
| C | **QA over a transcript** (grounded answers; per-transcript, later cross-meeting) | Long context + retrieval; faithfulness | `TranscriptChatViewModel` → `LLMService.chatStream`; live meeting `LiveAskPaneView` |
| D | **Tool / function calling** (drive app actions, agent mode) | A tool-trained model + tool plumbing we don't have yet | New — enables `2026-05-voice-command-agent-mode.md` |

Cleanup, summary, Ask, and Transforms are **already provider-agnostic** (they route through `LLMService` → `RoutingLLMClient`). Adding one local MLX provider makes A/B/C and selected-text Transforms local-by-default with **no call-site changes**. D needs new plumbing (§6).

---

## 3. Invariants / non-goals

- **One engine: MLX.** We do not build a multi-runtime hybrid. (Keep a thin `LocalLLMRuntime` protocol as cheap future insurance, but implement only MLX.)
- **One self-optimized model is the first-party path.** We pick/convert/quantize/fine-tune a single model for Apple Silicon and ship it as the default; depth of optimization over breadth of choice.
- **Apple Silicon only.** The MLX engine + our model require Apple Silicon (the app is already Apple-Silicon-only). The one-click local path must be hardware-gated/hidden so an unsupported Mac never surfaces a setup that cannot run.
- **On-device only for the local path.** No transcript text leaves the Mac when the local model is selected; indexing/retrieval for QA stays local.
- **Do not bundle a multi-GB model into the app binary.** Keep the DMG small; the model is a verified on-demand download into Application Support.
- **Preserve existing providers.** Cloud keys, Ollama, LM Studio, local CLI remain for power users. "BYO" for the in-process engine means **other MLX-format models**, not arbitrary formats.
- **Permissive licensing for anything we ship/fine-tune by default** — Apache-2.0 / MIT base only (see §5).
- **Accuracy beats latency.** When forced to choose for the default, pick the more accurate model/quant.
- **Graceful fallback.** On model-missing / load failure / OOM, fall back to the deterministic pipeline (and offer raw transcript) — never block dictation, never insert an error string.

## 4. Runtime decision: MLX

We want an in-process runtime on Apple Silicon, optimizable for a single model, supporting streaming + (eventually) tool-calling + long context, with zero terminal/extra-app friction.

**Decision: MLX (mlx-swift / mlx-swift-lm), as the single in-process engine.** Rationale, given we optimize one model rather than support every model:
- **Best Apple Silicon performance** — fastest small-model decode; large prefill gains on M5+. The right engine when the goal is to make *one* model run as well as possible on this hardware.
- **Cleanest native integration** — first-party Apple SwiftPM packages; no C++/Metal framework to vendor and codesign. Lower long-term integration burden.
- **Full self-optimization control** — MLX quantization (including DWQ 4-bit ≈ 6–8-bit quality), and a clear path to convert/fine-tune our own model into MLX format. Conversion is a one-time, deliberate step we own, not a per-user chore.
- **Ships in notarized apps** today (Metal shaders built via Xcode, `.metallib` bundled). Large models on macOS need **no special memory entitlement** (the `com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit` entitlement is iOS-only and does not apply on macOS) — fit is managed by RAM-gating model tiers and respecting the Metal wired-memory limit (see §9).

**Runtimes we are NOT using (and why):** llama.cpp/GGUF — its main advantage is universal "load any GGUF" BYO, which we are explicitly *not* prioritizing; not worth the C++ vendoring when we optimize one MLX model. MLC-LLM / Core ML — per-model compile/convert, weaker momentum. Bundled Ollama — a hidden second process. **Apple Foundation Models** — Apple's fixed ~3B model with a ~4096-token window; we can't self-optimize it and it can't summarize long transcripts without heavy chunking. Demoted to an **optional zero-download fallback** for eligible users (the public `FoundationModels` API — `LanguageModelSession` + `@Generable` — on macOS 26+ with Apple Intelligence enabled), never the primary "our model" path.

### Two tradeoffs MLX carries — and our mitigations (own the model)
1. **No built-in grammar-constrained decoding** (no GBNF equivalent on MLX-Swift). Affects **tool-calling (D)** and strict JSON extraction. Mitigations, in order: (a) **fine-tune our model** to emit reliable tool/JSON output and validate-and-retry; (b) implement/port a **logits processor** for constrained decoding when needed; (c) for guaranteed-structured tasks on eligible OS, use Apple Foundation Models' typed `@Generable`. Validate in Phase 0 since tool-calling is a stated future goal.
2. **Long-context prefill** can be slow on MLX for very long inputs. Mitigations: **map-reduce chunking + retrieval** (needed for long meetings regardless), KV/prompt caching, and choosing/fine-tuning an architecture with good long-context behavior. Validate the long-transcript path in Phase 0.

---

## 5. Model: a self-optimized, permissively-licensed model

We ship **one** first-party model (with optional RAM-tiered variants), built from a permissively-licensed base so we can redistribute and fine-tune freely.

- **Base candidate / starting default: `Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507`** — Apache-2.0, 256K context, top sub-8B instruction-following, light KV cache, competent tool-calling. Convert to MLX (4-bit DWQ ≈ 2.3 GB) and use the **non-thinking Instruct** checkpoint (cleanup wants determinism). This is the *base we optimize*, not necessarily the final shipped weights.
- **Self-optimization path:** (1) MLX convert + DWQ quantize and tune generation params; (2) fine-tune on transcript cleanup / summarization / QA style for higher faithfulness and our house formatting; (3) endgame = our own purpose-built MacParakeet model, published as MLX weights the one-click flow fetches.
- **Optional RAM tiers (same family for consistent prompts):** 16 GB → 4B; 32 GB → Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct (MoE, ~18.6 GB, ~3B-speed, near-flagship quality); 64 GB → 30B-A3B Q6/Q8. Start with the single 4B and add tiers only if the spike shows a clear quality gap.
- **License rule:** base/fine-tune only from **Apache-2.0 / MIT** (Qwen3, Mistral Apache models, Phi-4/-mini, SmolLM, IBM Granite 4.0, OLMo 2). Avoid Gemma 2/3 (custom terms) and Llama (community license + EU multimodal carve-out) as a base. (Gemma 4 reportedly moved to Apache — re-check if wanted.)
- **Specialized cleanup model (#265):** don't maintain a second first-party model. Parakeet already emits punctuation/casing, so cleanup *beyond* punctuation (disfluency, ITN, light rewrite) is best done by our tuned general model under a strict source-faithful prompt. #265's "plug in a tiny specialized cleanup model + control the prompt" is satisfied by **BYO (another MLX model) + the editable prompt**.

**Freshness flags (verify in Phase 0):** small-model rankings move fast; advertised context windows overstate *reliable* comprehension; confirm the exact base + quant on real transcripts before locking.

---

## 6. Architecture & integration seam

Our LLM stack is already cleanly abstracted; the change is additive.

**Today (verified):**
- `Sources/MacParakeetCore/Models/LLMProvider.swift` — `LLMProviderID` enum + `LLMProviderDescriptor` (incl. `isLocal`) + `LLMProviderConfig`.
- `Sources/MacParakeetCore/Services/LLM/LLMClient.swift` — `LLMClientProtocol` (`chatCompletion`, `chatCompletionStream`, `testConnection`, `listModels`).
- `RoutingLLMClient.swift` — routes by `providerConfig.id`.
- `LLMService.swift` — `formatTranscript` / `generatePromptResult`(summary) / `chat` / `transform`; **provider-agnostic**. ⚠️ Context budgets hardcoded in **chars** (cloud 500k / local 80k / lmStudio 8k) with silent middle-truncation → root of **#563**.
- `LLMConfigStore.swift` — config in UserDefaults, keys in Keychain.
- Model-download prior art: FluidAudio `AsrModels.download(version:progressHandler:)` + `STTRuntime.deleteParakeetModel` — reuse for the MLX model files.
- Tool-calling: **absent** (`ChatMessage` has no tools).

**To add the in-process MLX provider:**
1. `LLMProviderID` += `.inProcessLocal` (and optionally `.appleIntelligence` for the FM fallback); add descriptors (`isLocal: true`, `supportsAPIKey: false`). **`baseURL` contract:** `LLMProviderConfig.baseURL` is non-optional today, so the in-process provider uses a sentinel URL (e.g. `inprocess://local`) that the in-process client ignores; only revisit making `baseURL` optional if more in-process providers appear.
2. New `Sources/MacParakeetCore/Services/LLM/InProcessLLMClient.swift` implementing `LLMClientProtocol` over a thin `LocalLLMRuntime` protocol, with an **MLX implementation** (`MLXLLM` / `mlx-swift-lm`: `LLMModelFactory.loadContainer` → `ChatSession.respond`/streaming). Honor `Task.checkCancellation()`.
3. `RoutingLLMClient.client(for:)` += route `.inProcessLocal` → `InProcessLLMClient` (and `.appleIntelligence` → a `FoundationModelsLLMClient` if we add the fallback). Inject the new client through `RoutingLLMClient`'s initializer, mirroring how `cliClient` is provided today (eager injection). The **feature call sites and `LLMService`'s public API are unchanged** — only routing is extended. (The separate context-budget fix in step 6 *does* change `LLMService` internals — that is not a call-site change.)
4. New `InProcessModelDownloader` (reuse FluidAudio download/verify/delete pattern) + `InProcessModelManagerViewModel`. Models cached under `Application Support/MacParakeet/LLMModels/<id>/`. MLX models can also load via Hub download with progress.
5. Settings: add to provider order in `LLMSettingsView`/`LLMSettingsViewModel`; add the one-click card (§7).
6. **Fix context budgets (#563) — this changes `LLMService` internals** (the `cloud`/`local`/`lmStudio` char budgets + `truncateMiddle` live there): make budgets token-based and per-model (read the model's real context window) instead of hardcoded chars. Provider abstraction and call sites stay unchanged.
7. **Tool-calling (Phase 3):** extend `ChatMessage`/`ChatCompletionOptions`/`ChatCompletionResponse` with tool definitions + results; implement via a fine-tuned-for-tools model + validate/retry (and/or a logits processor / FM `@Generable`); wire allowlisted typed tools per `2026-05-voice-command-agent-mode.md`.

Build the **chunking / map-reduce / retrieval layer** for long transcripts regardless (summary/QA need it; mitigates MLX long-prefill).

---

## 7. One-click setup UX (hard requirement)

Setup must be **a single obvious action**. Lives in the Settings → AI card + onboarding AI step (extends [`2026-05-ai-setup-ux.md`](2026-05-ai-setup-ux.md): `.setUpNeeded` / `.ready` / `.cannotConnect`).

- **Hardware gate (first):** only offer the local path on Apple Silicon (see §3); on unsupported hardware, hide it and fall back to BYO/cloud messaging — never surface a one-click setup that cannot run.
- **Primary: one "Enable local AI" button** that runs **download our optimized model → verify → select → test → "Ready"**, with a progress bar (reuse speech-model download UI) and recoverable error states (network/disk/corrupt → re-validate; mirror speech-model download hardening). RAM-aware: pick the right tier for the machine, respecting the macOS Metal wired-memory limit.
- **Optional zero-download path** where Apple Intelligence is available: "Use on-device AI (no download)" via Foundation Models for short tasks; clearly secondary to our model.
- **Manage models:** delete, switch tier, and **BYO an MLX model** (power users / #265).
- **Fallback messaging:** if no local model and no key, AI features show a compact empty state pointing at this one button; dictation/transcription always work without it.

## 8. Phasing

**Phase 0 — Spike + evaluation (decision gate).** Stand up a minimal in-process **MLX** path (mlx-swift-lm) with the base candidate (Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507, DWQ). Evaluate on real MacParakeet transcripts: cleanup faithfulness, summary quality, QA groundedness, and a tool-calling/JSON-reliability probe — **vs the deterministic pipeline and vs a cloud model**. Measure on-device latency (prewarm + prompt-cache) and RAM on 16/32/64 GB, and **explicitly validate the two MLX risks** (structured-output reliability, long-transcript prefill). Output: confirmed base model + quant, the chunking approach, accept/reject thresholds met. *Accuracy is the gating metric.*

**Phase 1 — In-process MLX provider + one-click default.** Add `.inProcessLocal` + `InProcessLLMClient` (MLX) + downloader; ship the optimized default with the one-click card. Cleanup/summary/Ask/Transforms go local-by-default (no call-site changes). Fix #563 (token budgets). Resolves the core of #439, #550.

**Phase 2 — Self-optimization + tiers + fallback.** Fine-tune the model for our tasks (cleanup/summary faithfulness, house style); add RAM tiers if warranted; add the optional Apple Intelligence zero-download fallback; ship the map-reduce/retrieval layer for long transcripts. BYO MLX model for power users (#265).

**Phase 3 — Tool-calling + cross-meeting QA.** Add tool-calling (enables `2026-05-voice-command-agent-mode.md`) via a tools-tuned model + validation (and/or logits processor / FM); leverage the local model for cross-meeting/folder-scoped QA (#460), relaxing the "snippets-only to remote" constraint when inference is local (ties to meetings-workspace U6/U7).

**Phase 4 (endgame) — Our own model.** A purpose-built MacParakeet cleanup/summary model, published as MLX weights the one-click flow fetches.

---

## 9. Risks & mitigations

- **Quality bar not met at tolerable size** → Phase 0 gate; accuracy is the metric; deterministic fallback retained.
- **MLX structured-output gap (tool-calling/JSON)** → fine-tune for tool output + validate/retry; optional logits processor; FM `@Generable` where available.
- **MLX long-context prefill** → map-reduce/retrieval + KV/prompt caching; validate in Phase 0.
- **RAM / macOS Metal wired-memory limit** (≈67% ≤36 GB, ≈75% >36 GB unified memory) → RAM-gate recommendations; cap context/KV; quantize KV for long transcripts; free idle models. (No memory entitlement on macOS — that is iOS-only.)
- **Apple Silicon requirement** → gate/hide the one-click local path on unsupported hardware (see §3) so it never offers a setup that cannot run.
- **MLX API churn** (mlx-swift-lm repo split / breaking 3.x) → isolate behind `LocalLLMRuntime`, pin exact versions, own upgrades.
- **First-run latency** (model load + shader compile) → prewarm on AI entry; stable-prompt-prefix prompt cache.
- **Long-transcript truncation (#563)** → token budgets + map-reduce, not silent middle-drop.
- **License contamination** → automated check that the base/fine-tune is Apache-2.0/MIT.
- **Build/CI** → MLX Metal shaders need Xcode/`xcodebuild` (not bare `swift build`); ensure CI uses the full toolchain.

## 10. Success criteria

- Fresh-install user enables capable local AI **in one action**, no key, no extra app; transcript text never leaves the device.
- Cleanup/summary/Ask quality on real transcripts **meets or beats** the deterministic baseline by Phase 0 thresholds, and is "good enough vs cloud" for everyday use.
- Summary/QA work on long meeting/YouTube/file transcripts without silent truncation.
- The model is demonstrably **optimized for Apple Silicon** (latency/RAM acceptable on a 16 GB Mac), with a clear path to a fine-tuned MacParakeet model.

## 11. Open decisions for Daniel

1. **Confirm MLX as the single engine** (no llama.cpp/multi-runtime), with a thin `LocalLLMRuntime` seam as optional insurance?
2. **Base model:** Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 (Apache) as the starting base to convert/optimize, 30B-A3B tier only if the spike justifies it?
3. **Self-optimization roadmap:** convert+quantize first (Phase 1), fine-tune next (Phase 2), our own model as endgame (Phase 4) — agree on this sequencing?
4. **Apple Intelligence:** include as an optional zero-download fallback, or skip entirely to stay single-model?
5. **v1 scope:** cleanup + summary + Ask (Phase 1), tool-calling explicitly Phase 3?
