> Context for AI coding assistants working on MacParakeet.

## What is MacParakeet?

A **fast, private, local-first voice app** for macOS. The v0.6 release ships system-wide dictation, file/URL transcription, meeting recording, and optional local WhisperKit multilingual STT for Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and other languages outside Parakeet's coverage.

**North Star:** Fast, local-first voice app for Mac.

**Domain:** [macparakeet.com](https://macparakeet.com)

**Pricing:** Current public build is free and open-source (GPL-3.0); official paid distribution/support remains possible.

## Release Channels

| Channel | Agent Assumption | Features |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| Stable DMG | User-facing release, recommended for normal use | Dictation, file/video/YouTube transcription, meeting recording, optional WhisperKit, exports, vocabulary, AI features |
| `main` | Development | v0.6 release scope plus hidden calendar auto-start/reminder code under `AppFeatures.calendarEnabled = false` |

When editing public-facing docs, preserve this release boundary: v0.6 includes
meeting recording and WhisperKit. Calendar reminders, auto-start, and auto-stop
are implemented in source but hidden behind `AppFeatures.calendarEnabled =
false` pending hands-on end-to-end validation.

`README.md` in that folder before reading code.** The READMEs capture
non-obvious rules — threading invariants, "do not delete this,"
ordering constraints, ADR cross-references — that aren't visible
from grep. Folders with READMEs today: `Audio/`, `STT/`,
`TextProcessing/`, `Database/`, `Licensing/`.

## Tech Stack (Locked Decisions)

| Language | Swift 6.0 | SwiftUI for UI |
| Database | SQLite | GRDB (single file, dictation history + transcriptions + meeting recordings) |
| STT | Parakeet TDT 0.6B-v3 + optional WhisperKit | Parakeet via FluidAudio CoreML/ANE is default (~2.5% WER, 155x realtime, 25 European languages); WhisperKit adds broader local multilingual coverage |
| Audio | AVAudioEngine + ScreenCaptureKit | Mic capture for dictation; ScreenCaptureKit system audio + AVAudioEngine mic for meeting recording; FFmpeg (bundled) for video file conversion |
| YouTube | yt-dlp | Standalone macOS binary, weekly non-blocking auto-update via `--update` |
| Auto-Update | Sparkle 2 | In-app updates via EdDSA-signed appcast (non-App Store) |

## Product Context

MacParakeet is extracted from the OatFlow feature in Oatmeal but is maintained independently -- no shared packages, no monorepo dependencies.

| | MacParakeet | Oatmeal |
|---|-------------|---------|
| **Focus** | Voice dictation + file transcription + meeting recording | Meeting memory + calendar |
| **Complexity** | Simple, focused | Complex, powerful |
| **Pricing** | Current public build free/GPL; official paid distribution/support possible | Freemium + Pro |
| **Value prop** | "Fast local transcription" | "Remembers everything" |

## Product Decisions (Settled)

These decisions were made during spec review and are locked:

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Empty transcript UX | Silently dismiss | Short hold-to-talk with no speech = user changed their mind. No error card. |
| Audio retention | On/off toggle | Simpler than 3-tier (all/7d/never). Users who care about storage can manually delete. |
| Processing mode scope | Global default only | Set once in Vocabulary, applies to all dictations. No per-dictation picker on overlay. |
| Context awareness | Aspirational future | No version commitment. Don't promise what doesn't exist. Build post-launch. |

## Architecture Decisions (ADRs)

All ADRs are in `spec/adr/`. These are locked decisions -- don't second-guess them.

| ADR | Decision | File |
|-----|----------|------|
| ADR-001 | Parakeet TDT 0.6B-v3 as primary STT | `spec/adr/001-parakeet-stt.md` |
| ADR-002 | Local-first processing (amended: opt-in LLM providers, opt-out telemetry) | `spec/adr/002-local-only.md` |
| ADR-004 | Deterministic text processing pipeline | `spec/adr/004-deterministic-pipeline.md` |
| ADR-005 | First-run onboarding flow | `spec/adr/005-onboarding-first-run.md` |
| ADR-007 | FluidAudio CoreML migration (Python elimination) | `spec/adr/007-fluidaudio-coreml-migration.md` |
| ADR-009 | Custom hotkey support (any single key + chord combos) | `spec/adr/009-custom-hotkey.md` |
| ADR-010 | Speaker diarization via FluidAudio offline pipeline | `spec/adr/010-speaker-diarization.md` |
| ADR-011 | LLM via cloud API keys + optional local providers | `spec/adr/011-llm-cloud-and-local-providers.md` |
| ADR-012 | Self-hosted telemetry via Cloudflare (Worker + D1) | `spec/adr/012-telemetry-system.md` |
| ADR-013 | Prompt Library + multi-summary architecture | `spec/adr/013-prompt-library-multi-summary.md` |
| ADR-014 | Meeting recording via ScreenCaptureKit system audio | `spec/adr/014-meeting-recording.md` |
| ADR-015 | Concurrent dictation and meeting recording | `spec/adr/015-concurrent-dictation-meeting.md` |
| ADR-016 | Centralized STT runtime and two-slot scheduler | `spec/adr/016-centralized-stt-runtime-scheduler.md` |
| ADR-017 | Calendar-driven meeting auto-start (Phases 1 + 2 implemented but hidden from v0.6; Phase 3 proposed) | `spec/adr/017-calendar-meeting-auto-start.md` |
| ADR-018 | Live meeting Ask tab (Insights dropped per amendment; Ask shipped) | `spec/adr/018-live-meeting-insights-and-ask.md` |
| ADR-019 | Crash-resilient meeting recording (implemented) | `spec/adr/019-crash-resilient-meeting-recording.md` |
| ADR-020 | Live meeting notepad + memo-steered summaries (implemented) | `spec/adr/020-live-meeting-notepad-and-memo-summaries.md` |
| ADR-021 | WhisperKit as optional multilingual STT engine (implemented) | `spec/adr/021-whisperkit-multilingual-stt.md` |
| ADR-022 | Transforms — system-wide LLM rewrites on selected text (Phase 2 productized; flag-gated) | `spec/adr/022-transforms-system-wide-rewrite.md` |

> Historical/dormant ADRs (still in `spec/adr/`, kept for context): ADR-003 (one-time purchase pricing), ADR-006 (trial + license activation), ADR-008 (local LLM runtime). Current public builds are free/GPL-3.0 and unlocked. The old LemonSqueezy/trial entitlement plumbing is intentionally retained as future-option code for GPL-compatible official paid distribution/support; do not remove it as dead code without explicit owner direction and an ADR/spec update.

## Current Phase

**Current main branch** -- v0.6 release scope includes meeting recording and optional WhisperKit multilingual STT. Calendar auto-start/reminders are implemented in source but hidden behind `AppFeatures.calendarEnabled = false`.

- **v0.1** MVP -- System-wide dictation, file transcription, overlay, history, export, SQLite, CLI, STT engine
- **v0.2** Clean Pipeline -- Text processing (filler removal, custom words, snippets), Vocabulary UI, feedback form
- **v0.3** YouTube & Export -- YouTube URL transcription, multi-format export (TXT, MD, SRT, VTT, JSON, PDF, DOCX), drag-and-drop enhancements
- **v0.4** Polish + Launch -- Diarization, custom hotkeys, Sparkle updates, LLM providers, voice stats, distribution
- **v0.5** Data, UI & Prompts -- Private dictation, multi-conversation chat, favorites, video player, split-pane detail, library grid, prompt library, multi-summary, open-source release
- **v0.6** Meeting Recording + Multilingual STT -- ScreenCaptureKit system audio + AVAudioEngine mic capture with VPIO preferred, fragmented MP4 source files + crash recovery (ADR-019), transcript-layer suppression, concurrent with dictation (ADR-015), centralized STT runtime + scheduler (ADR-016), sacred-geometry recording pill + Notes/Transcript/Ask meeting panel, customizable Ask quick prompts, library integration, prompt/result/chat support (ADR-014), live notepad + memo-steered summaries with `{{userNotes}}` template variable + slash commands (ADR-020), plus optional WhisperKit engine support for non-Parakeet languages, persisted speech-engine preference, Whisper language picker/default, CLI `transcribe --engine parakeet|whisper --language`, Whisper model download path, and engine pinning for active meeting sessions and crash recovery (ADR-021)
- **Calendar auto-start** -- Implemented in code (ADR-017 Phases 1 + 2) but hidden from v0.6 by `AppFeatures.calendarEnabled = false`.

## Key Patterns

### Three Primary Modes + Transforms

MacParakeet has three primary capture modes plus a system-wide text-rewrite surface (ADR-022) in the `main` branch product direction:

1. **System-wide dictation** -- Press hotkey anywhere on macOS, speak, text is pasted (WisprFlow-style)
2. **File transcription** -- Drag-drop audio/video files or paste a YouTube link (MacWhisper-style)
3. **Meeting recording** -- Capture system audio + mic simultaneously, transcribe locally (simple Granola-style)
4. **Transforms** -- Select text anywhere on macOS, press a bound hotkey (⌥1 / ⌥2 / ⌥3 by default), and the selection is rewritten in place through the user's LLM provider. ADR-022. Phase 2 productized behind `AppFeatures.transformsEnabled` (default `false`, flipped after the website telemetry-allowlist deploy). Ships with three built-in Transforms: *Polish*, *Distill*, *Decide* — synthesized by a paired creative-director + staff-PM review on 2026-05-12 (Improve → Re-shape → Re-direct pedagogy). Reuses the spike's brand-finished floating pill (ADR-022 §4); user-bound shortcuts dispatch through a single process-wide `TransformsHotkeyRegistry`.

The three capture modes share the same STT scheduler/runtime path on `main` but have different UI flows, audio sources, and data models. Parakeet is the default engine; Whisper can be selected globally or per CLI call for languages Parakeet does not cover. **Dictation and meeting recording run concurrently** (ADR-015) -- a user can dictate freely during a meeting recording. Dictation and meeting microphone capture fan out from one process-wide `SharedMicrophoneStream`/AVAudioEngine; meeting system audio remains a separate ScreenCaptureKit stream. Transforms is unrelated to STT — it operates on whatever text is currently selected and sends it through the configured LLM provider.

The Transcribe tab is the unified capture surface — one place for all three modes (dictation can also start there via hotkey/menu bar, since dictation is global):

```
+--------------------------------------------------+
|  Transcribe a YouTube video |  Drop a file       |
|  [link field] [Transcribe]  |  [Browse Files]    |
|                             |                    |
+--------------------------------------------------+
|  ✿ Record Meeting       Capture system + mic ●   |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

The Meeting Recording tile (third row, ~96pt strip) reflects live recording state via a long-lived `MeetingRecordingPillViewModel` shared with the floating pill -- both surfaces stay in sync. Meeting browse lives under `Library`'s Meetings filter chip as a date-grouped list rather than the thumbnail grid the other filters use.

ADR-016 defines the STT architecture as one process-wide scheduler path with a reserved dictation slot and a shared background slot where meeting work outranks file transcription. ADR-021 extends that path with speech-engine routing, engine-switch guards, and meeting-session engine leases.

### STT Integration (Parakeet default, Whisper optional)

- Native Swift SDK via FluidAudio (CoreML on the Neural Engine)
- Parakeet TDT 0.6B-v3 returns word-level timestamps + confidence scores
- ~155x realtime on Apple Silicon (60 min audio in ~23 seconds)
- ~2.5% Word Error Rate
- ~66 MB working memory per active Parakeet inference slot (vs ~2 GB+ on GPU/MLX)
- ~6 GB CoreML speech model bundle downloaded during onboarding
- ~130 MB diarization asset bundle prepared alongside onboarding/default speaker-detection readiness
- WhisperKit is available as a local secondary engine for broader language coverage; default model variant is `large-v3-v20240930_turbo_632MB`
- Whisper language hints are optional (`auto` means detect); persisted default is stored in `UserDefaults` and exposed in Settings
- One process-wide `STTRuntime` owner manages model lifecycle for the app
- The default STT topology uses 2 execution slots: reserved dictation + shared meeting/batch
- One `STTScheduler` owns slot assignment, priority, backpressure, cancellation, and job-scoped progress
- Active meeting recordings capture the selected engine/language at start; engine switching is blocked while speech work or a meeting engine lease is active

**Project STT entry point:**
```swift
// App code uses the shared scheduler from AppEnvironment.
let result = try await sttScheduler.transcribe(
    audioPath: audioPath,
    job: .fileTranscription,
    onProgress: nil
)
// result.text contains the transcription
// result.words contains word-level timestamps + confidence
```

Use `STTRuntime`/`STTScheduler` for app flows. Direct `AsrModels`/`AsrManager`
usage belongs inside the runtime wrapper; creating standalone STT clients in app
code bypasses ADR-016's process-wide scheduler.

**Two-chip architecture:**
```
CPU:  MacParakeet app (UI, hotkeys, clipboard, history)
ANE:  Parakeet STT (via FluidAudio/CoreML) -- dedicated ML chip
CPU/GPU/CoreML as selected by WhisperKit: optional multilingual STT
```

### Database

- `macparakeet.db` (GRDB): Dictation history + transcription records in a single file
- No vector search or embeddings needed (unlike Oatmeal)
- One repository per table (GRDB pattern)
- `lifetime_dictation_stats` (v0.7.4): singleton counter row keeping headline voice stats (total words, total time, total count, longest dictation) alive through history deletion. Incremented in the same transaction as each completed dictation save. See `spec/01-data-model.md` and issue #124.

### Audio Capture

- **Dictation**: AVAudioEngine tap on input node (microphone)
- **File transcription**: FluidAudio's `AudioConverter` resamples audio; FFmpeg (bundled) demuxes video files
- **Meeting recording**: ScreenCaptureKit for system audio + AVAudioEngine for mic (dual-stream)

### Feedback & Community

In-app feedback creates GitHub Issues via a Cloudflare Pages Function. User emails are **never** posted in public issues.

**Responding to issues:**
- Be concise, genuine, no fluff
- If a feature request is already shipped, say so and close the issue
- If partially addressed, explain what's done and what's still open
- Cross-reference related issues

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Specs are the source of truth** -- Follow `spec/10-ai-coding-method.md` precedence: ADRs first, then narrative specs, then active plans, with `spec/kernel/*` as supporting feature/status and traceability context. If code and spec disagree, update code to match the highest-precedence spec (or update the spec if it is wrong).
2. **ADRs are locked** -- Don't second-guess architectural decisions in `spec/adr/`.
3. **Never lose user data** -- Graceful degradation for dictation history and transcriptions.
4. **UI philosophy** -- Minimal during dictation, rich for transcription results.
5. **Local-first** -- Speech recognition stays on-device by default. Optional provider and media-download flows are user-triggered; model/update flows and self-hosted telemetry/crash reporting are product-managed surfaces. Retained purchase activation endpoints remain in code but current public builds are free/GPL-3.0 and always unlocked. That licensing plumbing is intentionally retained as future-option code for GPL-compatible official paid distribution/support, not cleanup fodder. Telemetry is opt-out in Settings and never includes audio or transcript content.
6. **Simplicity is the product** -- Resist feature creep. MacParakeet does three things well.
7. **Fast feedback loops for agents** -- Design everything so the agent can verify its own work: tests for logic, CLI for headless smoke-testing, build errors that surface immediately.
8. **Bounded agent discretion** -- Agents should choose the simplest process that preserves correctness, traceability, and ADR constraints. Kernel updates should be proportional to risk and user visibility.
9. **Protect the context zone** -- For behavior changes, explicitly define in-scope requirements, out-of-scope behavior, and invariants before coding.

## Documentation Hygiene

**Keep docs aligned with code.** Stale documentation is worse than no documentation.

After completing work: update spec progress in `spec/README.md` and `spec/02-features.md`, update README/agent docs when user-visible behavior or release status changes, archive completed plans to `plans/completed/`, and mark outdated docs with `> Status: **HISTORICAL**` headers.

Document status headers: `**ACTIVE**` (authoritative), `**IMPLEMENTED**` (done, still accurate), `**HISTORICAL**` (superseded), `**PROPOSAL**` (under discussion).

Source-of-truth precedence: ADR > narrative spec > active plan > kernel index/traceability > code/comments.

## Working with Plans

Plans live in `plans/` and are version-controlled. Create a plan for multi-file changes, new features, architectural changes, or complex refactoring. Skip plans for bug fixes, typos, single-file changes. See existing plans in `plans/completed/` for format examples.

## Common Tasks

### Add a new feature

1. Read relevant spec (e.g., `spec/02-features.md`) and `spec/10-ai-coding-method.md`
2. Identify existing requirement IDs, or add one in `spec/kernel/requirements.yaml` for notable user-visible/public behavior
3. Create a plan in `plans/active/` if multi-file
4. Implement in `Sources/MacParakeetCore/` (logic) and `Sources/MacParakeet/` (UI)
5. Add/update tests in `Tests/MacParakeetTests/`
6. Update `spec/kernel/traceability.md` if source/test mappings changed
7. Run focused tests, then `swift test` before merge
8. Update spec progress markers

### Add a new database table

1. Update `spec/01-data-model.md` with schema
2. Add migration in `Sources/MacParakeetCore/Database/DatabaseManager.swift` (inline migrations)
3. Add model in `Sources/MacParakeetCore/Models/`
4. Add repository in `Sources/MacParakeetCore/Database/{Name}Repository.swift`
5. Run `swift test` to verify migrations

### Fix a bug

1. Write a test that reproduces the bug
2. Run focused tests (should fail)
3. Fix the bug
4. Run focused tests (should pass), then run `swift test` before merge
5. Commit with test + fix together

### Release a new build

Full guide: `docs/distribution.md`. Quick steps:

0. **Pre-flight:** Run `swift test` (all must pass). Check current version: `curl -s "https://macparakeet.com/appcast.xml" | grep sparkle:shortVersionString`. Decide version bump -- patch (0.1.x) for fixes, minor (0.x.0) for features.
1. **Build:** `VERSION=X.Y.Z scripts/dist/build_app_bundle.sh`
2. **Sign + notarize:** `scripts/dist/sign_notarize.sh`
   - After signing, smoke-test bundled helpers: `dist/MacParakeet.app/Contents/Resources/yt-dlp --version`.
   - `yt-dlp_macos` is a PyInstaller binary. If it is signed with hardened runtime, it must have `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation=true`; otherwise fresh installs can fail on first YouTube use with `[PYI:ERROR] Failed to load Python shared library ... different Team IDs`.
3. **Upload DMG to R2:** `npx wrangler r2 object put macparakeet-downloads/MacParakeet.dmg --file dist/MacParakeet.dmg --content-type "application/x-apple-diskimage" --remote`
4. **Verify R2 file size matches local:** `curl -sI "https://downloads.macparakeet.com/MacParakeet.dmg?ts=$(date +%s)" | grep content-length` -- must equal `stat -f%z dist/MacParakeet.dmg`
5. **Sign for Sparkle:** `.build/artifacts/sparkle/Sparkle/bin/sign_update dist/MacParakeet.dmg`
6. **Update appcast:** Edit `~/code/macparakeet-website/public/appcast.xml` -- **prepend** new `<item>` (keep all previous items). Include build number, version, signature, length, `pubDate` (`date -R`), release notes.
7. **Deploy website:** `cd ~/code/macparakeet-website && git add public/appcast.xml && git commit && git push && npx astro build && npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name macparakeet-website --branch main`
8. **Verify:** `curl -s "https://macparakeet.com/appcast.xml?ts=$(date +%s)" | grep sparkle:version`

**Critical:** The DMG uploaded to R2 must be the **exact same file** you ran `sign_update` on. If sizes don't match, Sparkle rejects the update.

## Testing

**Philosophy:** "Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration."

See `spec/09-testing.md` for full strategy. Key points:

| Category | What | How |
|----------|------|-----|
| Unit | Pure logic, models, text processing | XCTest, fast |
| Database | CRUD, queries, migrations | In-memory SQLite |
| Integration | Service boundaries, STT pipeline | Protocol mocks |

### Running Tests

```bash
swift test              # Full deterministic suite, usually ~1-2 minutes
swift test --parallel   # Optional parallel run when chasing wall-clock time
```

### AI Agent Testing Loop

1. **Before coding:** `swift test` to establish baseline
2. **After changes:** `swift test` to verify no regressions
3. **Bug fix:** Write test that reproduces bug, then fix
4. Tests must be: **deterministic**, reasonably fast, and have **clear errors**. Use focused tests for quick iteration; the full suite usually takes ~1-2 minutes.

### What We Skip

- SwiftUI view tests (test ViewModels instead)
- Audio capture tests (test processing logic with fixtures)
- Third-party library internals (trust GRDB, FluidAudio)

## Building

```bash
# Build, code-sign, and launch the dev app
scripts/dev/run_app.sh

# Optional: force a specific signing identity for the dev .app bundle
MACPARAKEET_CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Apple Development: Your Name (TEAMID)" scripts/dev/run_app.sh

# Build and run CLI -- public surface, semver tracked in Sources/CLI/CHANGELOG.md.
# See AGENTS.md (this repo) and integrations/README.md (downstream agents) for context.
swift build --target CLI
swift run macparakeet-cli --help
swift run macparakeet-cli --version    # 1.0.0+
swift run macparakeet-cli transcribe /path/to/audio.mp3
swift run macparakeet-cli health

# Run tests
swift test

# Open in Xcode
open Package.swift  # Select MacParakeet scheme
```

## File Locations (Runtime)

| Item | Path |
|------|------|
| App bundle | `/Applications/MacParakeet.app` |
| Database | `~/Library/Application Support/MacParakeet/macparakeet.db` |
| Parakeet STT models | FluidAudio default cache (CoreML, ~6 GB) |
| Whisper STT models | `~/Library/Application Support/MacParakeet/models/stt/whisper/` |
| yt-dlp binary | `~/Library/Application Support/MacParakeet/bin/yt-dlp` |
| FFmpeg binary | `~/Library/Application Support/MacParakeet/bin/ffmpeg` |
| Settings | `~/Library/Preferences/com.macparakeet.plist` |
| Temp audio | `$TMPDIR/macparakeet/` |
| Logs | `~/Library/Logs/MacParakeet/` |

## Security and Privacy

| Permission | Reason | When Requested |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| Microphone | Dictation + meeting recording | First dictation use |
| Accessibility | Global hotkey, paste simulation | First dictation use |
| Screen & System Audio Recording | System audio capture for meeting recording (ScreenCaptureKit) | First meeting recording use |

1. **Offline-first** -- Dictation and file transcription work fully offline. Network is limited to user-triggered downloads/providers, update checks, retained purchase activation endpoints if explicitly invoked, and opt-out anonymous telemetry.
2. **Temp files deleted** -- Audio removed after transcription (unless user saves)
3. **Non-identifying telemetry** -- Anonymous, session-scoped, opt-out in Settings. No persistent IDs, no IP storage, no content. See `docs/telemetry.md` and ADR-012.
4. **No accounts** -- No login, no email, no tracking

## Good Patterns to Follow

### Code Patterns

| Pattern | Why | Example |
|---------|-----|---------|
| In-memory SQLite for tests | Fast, isolated, no cleanup needed | Use GRDB's `DatabaseQueue(configuration:)` with in-memory config |
| Protocol-based services | Makes mocking easy for tests | Define `TranscriptionServiceProtocol`, implement concrete + mock |
| GRDB repositories (one per table) | Clean separation, consistent CRUD | `DictationRepository`, `TranscriptionRepository` |
| KeylessPanel for non-activating overlays | NSPanel that never steals focus | Subclass with `canBecomeKey -> false` for dictation overlay |
| Timer in .common run-loop mode | `.default` mode pauses during UI tracking (slider drag) | `RunLoop.main.add(timer, forMode: .common)` |
| DesignSystem tokens | Consistent styling, easy to change globally | Centralize spacing, typography, colors in `DesignSystem.swift` |
| `parakeetAction(_:)` button roles | Semantic intent at the callsite — abstracts `.buttonStyle + .tint` composition; one coral CTA per surface | `.parakeetAction(.primary / .primaryProminent / .secondary / .destructive / .destructiveProminent / .subtle)`. Never re-tint the SwiftUI environment with `.tint(coral)` at NSHostingView roots — coral cascades only from `parakeetAction`. |
| TextProcessingPipeline as pure function | No side effects, easy to test | Input text -> output text, no state mutation |
| Cache computed values with signature check | Avoid O(n) work every frame | Check record ID + word count + timestamps before rebuilding |

### Architecture Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Manual NSApplication.run() | No SwiftUI `App` protocol -- manual `NSApplication.shared.run()` for reliable CLI execution without .app bundle. Same pattern as Oatmeal. |
| NSStatusItem for menu bar | Menu bar via `NSStatusBar.system.statusItem()`, not SwiftUI `MenuBarExtra` |
| NSWindow + NSHostingView | Main window created programmatically, SwiftUI content hosted via `NSHostingView` |
| Core library has no SwiftUI views | `MacParakeetCore` is primarily Foundation + GRDB + FluidAudio plus optional WhisperKit. AppKit is limited to small macOS adapter services (`ClipboardService`, `PermissionService`, `TelemetryService` termination notification, `ExportService`) and must not introduce UI ownership. |
| ViewModels in separate target | `MacParakeetViewModels/` -- testable without GUI, depends only on Core |
| Views organized by feature | `Views/Dictation/`, `Views/Transcription/`, not flat |
| Observable ViewModels | `@MainActor @Observable` on all ViewModels |
| Async/await for all I/O | No completion handlers, no Combine for new code |

## Known Pitfalls (from OatFlow Experience)

These are hard-won lessons. Don't repeat them.

### Swift Language Gotchas

- **`??` with `try await` does not work** -- Swift's `??` uses an autoclosure for the RHS, which doesn't support async/throwing. Use `if let ... else` instead of `title ?? (try await getTitle())`.
- **Fire-and-forget `Task` for async side-effects loses results** -- Don't use `Task { try await ... }` inside a sync function if the caller needs the result. Make the function `async` and `await` directly.
- **Force-unwrap `UTType(filenameExtension:)` can be nil** -- Unregistered extensions return nil. Always use `if let`.
- **`nonisolated` + existential protocol types conflict** -- Changing an actor's stored property from a concrete type to `any Protocol` breaks `nonisolated` access. Either drop `nonisolated` or keep the concrete type.

### UI/AppKit Gotchas

- **Don't block @MainActor with long-running work** -- Use `Task.detached` for heavy work, hop back to MainActor for UI updates.
- **Tooltips on non-activating NSPanel need AppKit-level NSTrackingArea** -- `.help()`, `.onHover`, and `NSViewRepresentable` with `.activeInActiveApp` all fail on `.nonactivatingPanel`. Only `NSTrackingArea` with `.activeAlways` works.
- **Segmented Picker `.labelsHidden()`** -- SwiftUI `Picker` with `.segmented` style shows its label string unless `.labelsHidden()` is applied.
- **Segmented Picker label truncation** -- 5+ segments in a sidebar-width picker will truncate. Use shorter labels.

### Database Gotchas

- **Raw SQL UPDATE with UUID -- use GRDB's `fetchOne(key:)` + `update()` pattern** -- GRDB stores UUID values via Codable encoding, which may differ from `id.uuidString`. Never use raw SQL `WHERE id = ?` with `uuidString`.
- **`PermissionService` is not a singleton** -- Instantiate it (`PermissionService()`), don't use `.shared`.

### General

- **Dead code from iterating on approaches** -- When switching approaches, delete old code entirely. Don't leave `_ = unusedVar` artifacts.
- **Retained purchase activation is intentional** -- Do not delete `EntitlementsService`, `LemonSqueezyLicenseAPI`, entitlement state, or trial/license telemetry as dead code unless the project owner explicitly requests it and the decision is reflected in an ADR/spec update.
- **Meeting recovery artifacts are user data** -- Do not delete meeting session folders, lock files, or source audio outside the recovery/discard flows without explicit user intent.
- **CLI is a public contract** -- Preserve `macparakeet-cli` behavior and update `Sources/CLI/CHANGELOG.md` for compatibility-relevant changes.
- **PyInstaller helpers need library-validation care** -- Bundled `yt-dlp_macos` unpacks and `dlopen`s an embedded Python framework. Developer ID + hardened runtime signing without `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation=true` breaks fresh installs at first YouTube transcription/playback with a Team ID mismatch.
- **Review agents catch real bugs** -- Running a review agent on critical flows catches P0 issues. Worth the 60 seconds.
- **CI duplicates without workflow concurrency** -- Add `concurrency` with `cancel-in-progress: true` and a stable group key to avoid duplicate pipelines.
