# ADR-015: Concurrent Dictation and Meeting Recording

> Status: ACCEPTED
> Date: 2026-04-06
> Related: ADR-014 (meeting recording), ADR-009 (custom hotkeys), ADR-016 (centralized STT runtime and scheduler), [GitHub #57](https://github.com/moona3k/macparakeet/issues/57), [PR #189](https://github.com/moona3k/macparakeet/pull/189)
> Amended by: ADR-016 for STT runtime ownership, scheduling, and backpressure policy
> Amendment note (2026-04-10): meeting mic capture remains raw at device tap time; echo mitigation is applied in meeting-only joined software-AEC processing while dictation remains raw. Concurrency isolation remains unchanged.
> Amendment note (2026-04-29, superseded 2026-04-30): meeting system audio moved from Core Audio process taps to ScreenCaptureKit audio, and meeting mic capture now prefers VPIO. Dictation remained raw on its independent `AVAudioEngine` until the shared-engine amendment below replaced that topology.
> Amendment note (2026-04-30): the original "independent AVAudioEngine instances" decision was incompatible with VPIO. coreaudiod attaches the VPAU aggregate device to the **process**, not the engine, so once meeting recording engaged VPIO, every other `AVAudioEngine` in the process inherited the multi-channel duplex layout — and dictation read silence on channel 0 of the wrong layout. Section 1 is rewritten below to describe the shared-engine architecture that ships in v0.6 (PR #189). The rest of the ADR (STT scheduler, menu bar priority, UI layers, hotkey, audio semantics) is unchanged.

## Context

ADR-014 introduced meeting recording as a third co-equal mode. The initial implementation mutually excludes dictation and meeting recording — starting one blocks the other. This was a simplifying constraint for MVP, but it conflicts with the product vision: a user in a 45-minute meeting recording should still be able to press their dictation hotkey to quickly dictate a Slack message.

Both flows need microphone access, both use the Parakeet STT engine, both display UI elements (pills/overlays), and both own menu bar icon state. The question is whether they can run concurrently in a reliable, architecturally clean way.

## Decision

### Dictation and meeting recording run concurrently as fully independent pipelines

There is no mutual exclusion. A user can start a meeting recording, then use dictation as many times as they want during the meeting. Both flows operate independently with no shared mutable state between them.

### 1. Shared microphone engine, independent system audio

Microphone capture is owned by a process-wide `SharedMicrophoneStream`. Both flows subscribe and receive every buffer; system audio remains a separate ScreenCaptureKit pipeline owned by the meeting flow.

| Flow | Audio Source | Subscription |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| Dictation | `SharedMicrophoneStream` | `subscribe(wantsVPIO: false)` |
| Meeting (mic) | `SharedMicrophoneStream` | `subscribe(wantsVPIO: true)` (VPIO preferred, raw fallback) |
| Meeting (system) | `SystemAudioStream` (ScreenCaptureKit `SCStream`) | independent of mic engine |

The shared stream owns one `AVAudioEngine`, manages VPIO engagement, fans buffers out to all subscribers, and tears down only when the last subscriber leaves. Subscribers receive the same buffer; both flows' downstream copies are isolated.

**Why a shared engine is required (not optional):**

macOS Voice Processing I/O (VPIO) provides built-in echo cancellation, noise suppression, and AGC, which we want for meeting recording. VPIO is engaged by enabling voice processing on an `AVAudioEngine`'s input node, which causes `coreaudiod` to attach a VPAU aggregate device (`CADefaultDeviceAggregate-<pid>-N`) to the **process**. The aggregate then routes audio for every `AVAudioEngine` in the process — including a separately-allocated dictation engine, whose `inputNode.outputFormat(forBus: 0)` queries return the VPAU's multi-channel duplex layout (typically `ch=9`) instead of the raw mic format. Channel 0 carries the post-AEC processed mono; the rest are reference / loopback channels. A dictation engine that doesn't know about the duplex layout reads channel 0 of *something else* (or applies default channel reduction and dilutes the AEC), which manifests as silent transcripts during meetings.

Two independent `AVAudioEngine` instances cannot escape this — VPIO state is process-scoped, not engine-scoped. The shared-engine design accepts this and exploits it: subscribers explicitly request VPIO or raw, the stream resolves the engine's actual mode (sticky once engaged, deferred when a non-VPIO subscriber blocks), and every subscriber that consumes audio while VPIO is engaged extracts channel 0 as mono. See `Sources/MacParakeetCore/Audio/SharedMicrophoneStream.swift` and `extractChannelZero(from:)` in `AudioRecorder.swift` for the implementation.

**Why a shared engine is also fine for lifecycle:** the original ADR worried that a long-running meeting engine would glitch when dictation start/stop touched it. In practice, dictation `subscribe`/`unsubscribe` calls are buffer-fanout list mutations behind a lock — they don't touch the running `AVAudioEngine`, don't reconfigure VPIO, and don't restart the engine. The engine starts on the first subscriber and stops on the last; mid-session subscribers join an already-running engine.

### 2. Shared STT runtime with explicit scheduling

Both flows submit STT work to a process-wide STT scheduler backed by one shared `STTRuntime` owner. Feature services do not own their own runtimes and the app does not rely on implicit CoreML contention as its scheduling policy.

The scheduler defines:

- a reserved dictation slot for the highest-priority interactive workload
- a shared background slot where meeting finalization beats live preview work
- meeting live chunks as best-effort under backlog
- file / YouTube transcription and legacy saved-meeting fallbacks as queued batch work behind active meeting STT
- saved meetings with archived source metadata reuse the higher-priority meeting-finalization path instead of the generic mixed-file path

See ADR-016 for the full runtime and scheduler design.

### 3. Priority-based menu bar icon

Both flows update the menu bar icon. A priority aggregator resolves conflicts:

```
Priority (highest → lowest):
1. Meeting recording active  →  recording indicator
2. Dictation active          →  recording indicator
3. File transcription        →  processing indicator
4. Idle                      →  default icon
```

The aggregator is a stateless function that checks all flow states and returns the highest-priority icon. It replaces the current direct `updateMenuBarIcon()` calls from each flow.

### 4. Independent UI layers

All UI surfaces are independent `NSPanel` instances with no z-order conflicts:

| Surface | When Visible | Layer |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Idle pill | Neither flow active | `.floating` |
| Dictation overlay | During dictation | `.floating` (above idle pill) |
| Meeting pill | During meeting recording | `.floating` |
| Meeting panel | User-opened during meeting | `.floating` |

During concurrent operation:
- Idle pill is hidden (either flow active)
- Meeting pill remains visible
- Dictation overlay appears on top during dictation, disappears when done
- Meeting pill stays visible underneath — the meeting is still recording

### 5. Hotkey conflict prevention (already solved)

`HotkeyRecorderView.additionalValidation` prevents assigning the same hotkey to both dictation and meeting recording. At runtime, `GlobalShortcutManager` ensures distinct hotkeys map to distinct handlers. No change needed.

### 6. Audio semantics are correct without deduplication

During concurrent operation, the user's dictation speech appears in both streams:
- **Dictation** captures it → STT → paste to clipboard (correct — that's what the user said)
- **Meeting mic** captures it → appears in meeting transcript (correct — the user spoke during the meeting)

No deduplication is needed. Both representations are semantically accurate.

## Implementation

### Remove mutual exclusion and preserve idle pill suppression

1. `DictationFlowCoordinator.startDictation()` — remove `guard !isMeetingRecordingActive()` check
2. `AppDelegate.toggleMeetingRecording()` — remove `guard dictationFlowCoordinator?.isDictationActive != true` check and `presentMeetingRecordingBlockedAlert()`
3. `DictationFlowCoordinator` — rename the `isMeetingRecordingActive` closure to `shouldSuppressIdlePill`, keep it for idle pill suppression, and guard `showIdlePill()` so the idle pill does not reappear while meeting recording is active

### Add MenuBarIconAggregator

A lightweight function (not a new class) that replaces direct `updateMenuBarIcon()` calls:

```swift
private func resolveMenuBarIcon() -> BreathWaveIcon.MenuBarState {
    if meetingRecordingFlowCoordinator?.isMeetingRecordingActive == true { return .recording }
    if dictationFlowCoordinator?.isDictationActive == true { return .recording }
    if transcriptionViewModel.isTranscribing { return .processing }
    return .idle
}
```

Both flows call `resolveMenuBarIcon()` instead of directly setting their state.

### Adjust idle pill visibility

Idle pill hides when either flow is active, shows when both are idle.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Users can dictate freely during meetings — the primary use case
- No architectural coupling between the two flows
- One process-wide `AVAudioEngine` instead of two — fewer Core Audio resources, no cross-engine VPIO contention
- STT ownership can remain centralized even while audio capture is fanned out per-subscriber

### Negative

- Buffer fan-out runs on the audio render thread; subscribers must do only lightweight work in their handlers (the stream's documented contract is "copy and dispatch off-thread for anything heavier"). `AudioRecorder` honours this by copying the tap buffer and processing on a serial userInitiated queue
- Device info from the platform is not yet plumbed through to dictation telemetry — `recordingDeviceInfo` is `nil` for shared-stream recordings (tracked as follow-up)
- Menu bar icon can only show one state — user must infer meeting is still recording from the meeting pill when dictation is briefly active

### Risk assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| VPIO duplex layout misread by a subscriber | Low | High | `extractChannelZero(from:)` is the design rule; centralized in shared code |
| Slow handler blocks the audio render thread | Low | High | Subscribers copy + dispatch; documented in stream's `BufferHandler` contract |
| STT queue starvation | Low | Medium | Explicit scheduler and backpressure policy in ADR-016 |
| UI layer collision | Low | Low | NSPanel z-ordering is deterministic |
| Engine death mid-session | Low | High | `onEngineDeath` callbacks notify subscribers; meeting/dictation surface as stall errors |
