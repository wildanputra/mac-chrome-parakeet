# ADR-001: Parakeet TDT 0.6B-v3 as Primary STT Engine

> Status: **Accepted**
> Date: 2026-02-08
> Runtime Note (2026-02-13): Runtime/mechanism details in this ADR are historical and superseded by ADR-007. ADR-001 remains authoritative for STT model choice.
> Note: GPU/LLM references (Qwen3-8B, "three-chip") are historical — the old on-device mlx-swift-lm path was removed 2026-02-23. Current LLM features use external providers or local CLI, while the speech runtime remains a two-chip architecture (CPU + ANE).
> Amendment (2026-04-28): Parakeet remains the **primary/default** STT engine. It is no longer the only engine. ADR-021 adds WhisperKit as an optional local multilingual engine for languages outside Parakeet's coverage.
> Amendment (2026-05-30): The Parakeet family now exposes both FluidAudio builds. Multilingual v3 remains the default/primary model chosen by this ADR; English-only v2 is an opt-in Parakeet model for users who want a faster no-auto-detect English path.
> Amendment (2026-06-08): Nemotron 3.5 is added as an opt-in Beta local multilingual engine through FluidAudio/CoreML. Parakeet v3 remains the primary/default STT engine; Nemotron is not a default replacement until real MacParakeet corpus benchmarks justify promotion.
> Amendment (2026-06-11): Nemotron Speech Streaming EN 0.6B (`english-1120ms`) is added as a second opt-in Beta build under the Nemotron engine, a peer of the multilingual build the way Parakeet v2 is a peer of v3. Parakeet v3 remains the primary/default STT engine; promotion of either Nemotron build still requires real MacParakeet corpus benchmarks.

## Context

MacParakeet needs a fast, accurate, local speech-to-text engine for macOS on Apple Silicon. The STT engine is the core of the product -- it must be fast enough for real-time dictation, accurate enough for professional use, and run entirely on-device to honor our local-only commitment (see ADR-002).

The two leading local STT options are:

| Model | Speed | WER | Optimization |
|-------|-------|-----|--------------|
| Whisper (various sizes) | 15-30x realtime | 7-12% | ONNX, CoreML, MLX |
| Parakeet TDT 0.6B-v3 | ~300x realtime | ~6.3% | MLX (Apple Silicon native) |

Whisper has broader ecosystem support and language coverage (100+ languages including CJK), but Parakeet is faster, more accurate for English, and better optimized for Apple Silicon. Parakeet TDT v3 supports 25 European languages natively with auto-detection, though accuracy varies by language (~3-5% WER for English/Italian/Spanish/Portuguese, ~6-12% for French/German/Russian, higher for others).

## Decision

Use **Parakeet TDT 0.6B-v3** as the primary/default STT engine.

The original runtime described here used a Python daemon. ADR-007 superseded that runtime with FluidAudio CoreML/ANE. ADR-021 later added WhisperKit as an optional secondary engine. A 2026-05 update exposed FluidAudio's v2 English-only Parakeet build as an opt-in variant. A 2026-06 amendment adds Nemotron 3.5 as an opt-in Beta local engine. The durable decision in this ADR is v3's default/primary status.

## Rationale

### Speed

Parakeet TDT 0.6B-v3 achieves approximately **300x realtime** on Apple Silicon via MLX. This means a 60-second audio clip transcribes in ~0.2 seconds. Whisper large-v3, by comparison, achieves 15-30x realtime depending on quantization and optimization -- an order of magnitude slower.

For dictation, speed is critical. Users expect their words to appear almost instantly after they stop speaking. Parakeet's speed makes sub-second transcription the norm, not the exception.

### Accuracy

Parakeet TDT 0.6B-v3 achieves **~6.3% Word Error Rate** on standard benchmarks, compared to Whisper's 7-12% depending on model size. More importantly:

- **Better technical vocabulary**: Parakeet handles programming terms, product names, and technical jargon more reliably than Whisper.
- **Better punctuation**: Parakeet outputs well-punctuated text natively, reducing the need for post-processing.
- **Word-level timestamps**: Parakeet provides per-word timestamps and confidence scores, enabling precise audio-text alignment.

### Apple Silicon Optimization

Parakeet TDT 0.6B-v3 is specifically optimized for Apple Silicon through MLX. It leverages the Neural Engine and unified memory architecture effectively. Whisper can run on Apple Silicon but was not designed for it -- MLX ports exist but performance is secondary to Parakeet's native optimization.

### Model Size

At 0.6B parameters (quantized to ~600MB on disk, ~1.5GB downloaded with tokenizer and config), Parakeet is compact enough to bundle or download on first launch without being burdensome. Whisper large-v3 is 1.5B parameters and requires significantly more memory.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Sub-second transcription for typical dictation segments
- Better accuracy than Whisper for English and major European languages
- Native Apple Silicon performance via MLX
- Compact model size (~1.5GB download)
- Word-level timestamps and confidence scores included

### Negative

- **Requires Python daemon**: The parakeet-mlx library is Python-based, requiring a Python runtime managed by `uv`. This adds complexity to the app bundle and first-launch experience.
- **~1.5GB model download**: Users must download the model on first launch. Must handle this gracefully with progress indication and offline fallback messaging.
- **Apple Silicon only**: No Intel Mac support. This is acceptable given Apple Silicon's market penetration (all Macs since late 2020) and our target audience.
- **European languages only**: Parakeet TDT 0.6B-v3 supports 25 European languages natively with auto-detection, but does not cover CJK, Arabic, Hindi, or other non-European languages. ADR-021 resolves this product gap with optional local WhisperKit, while keeping Parakeet as the default.

### Implementation Notes

- Python daemon managed via `uv` bootstrap (isolated venv, no system Python dependency)
- JSON-RPC protocol over stdin/stdout for Swift-Python communication
- Model downloaded on first launch with progress UI
- Daemon lifecycle managed by the Swift app (start on launch, stop on quit)

## Addendum: Runtime Migration to FluidAudio CoreML (February 2026)

> Date: 2026-02-13

**The model choice (Parakeet TDT 0.6B-v3) is unchanged.** The runtime is migrating from parakeet-mlx (Python/MLX/GPU) to FluidAudio (Swift/CoreML/ANE).

### What Changed

| Dimension | Original (ADR-001) | Updated |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| Runtime | parakeet-mlx (Python daemon, JSON-RPC) | FluidAudio SDK (native Swift, CoreML) |
| Runs on | GPU (Metal via MLX) | ANE (Neural Engine via CoreML) |
| Speed | ~300x realtime | ~155x realtime |
| WER | ~6.3% | ~2.5% (improved decoding) |
| Working RAM | ~1.5-2 GB (GPU pool) | ~66 MB |
| Model download | ~1.5-2.5 GB (MLX weights) | ~465 MB fetched components per Parakeet build (current); full CoreML repos are larger |
| Dependencies | Python + uv + venv | SwiftPM (FluidAudio) |
| IPC | JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout | In-process async/await |

### Why

1. **Three-chip utilization** — Moving STT to the ANE frees the GPU entirely for the Qwen3-8B LLM. Zero compute contention.
2. **Memory efficiency** — ~66 MB working RAM (vs ~2 GB+) makes 8GB Macs viable for both STT and LLM simultaneously.
3. **Better accuracy** — FluidAudio's CoreML decoding achieves ~2.5% WER (vs ~6.3% on MLX). Same model weights, better decoding.
4. **Eliminates Python** — No venv, no subprocess, no codesigning issues. Pure Swift. App Store compatible.
5. **Simpler architecture** — Native Swift async/await replaces JSON-RPC daemon management.

### Consequences Update

The "Requires Python daemon" negative consequence from the original ADR is resolved. The pre-implementation concern about a very large full CoreML repo download is mitigated in current FluidAudio usage: MacParakeet fetches only the loaded components, roughly ~465 MB per Parakeet build.

See `docs/research/fluidaudio-stt-migration.md` for the full evaluation.

## Addendum: Optional WhisperKit Secondary Engine (April 2026)

> Date: 2026-04-28

Parakeet remains the default engine for dictation, file transcription, and meeting recording. WhisperKit is available as an explicit local secondary engine for broader multilingual coverage. The user can select it in Settings or per CLI invocation. Active meeting recordings capture the engine/language at start so live preview, final transcription, and crash recovery stay deterministic.

See ADR-021 for the full decision.

## Addendum: Optional Nemotron Beta Engine (June 2026)

> Date: 2026-06-08

Parakeet remains the default engine for dictation, file transcription, and meeting recording. Nemotron 3.5 ASR Streaming 0.6B is available as an explicit Beta local engine through FluidAudio/CoreML. It can be selected in Settings or per CLI invocation, and active meeting recordings capture the engine/language at start so live preview, final transcription, and crash recovery stay deterministic.

Nemotron is labeled Beta because the first MacParakeet smoke benchmark showed strong warm-path speed but weaker English-heavy transcript quality than Parakeet on the synthetic corpus. It should not replace Parakeet as the default without a larger real-world dictation/meeting benchmark.

## Addendum: Nemotron English Beta Build (June 2026)

> Date: 2026-06-11

The Nemotron engine now exposes two builds, selected through a persisted
Nemotron model preference (Settings build picker, `config set nemotron-model`,
`models select nemotron-english-1120ms`, or `transcribe --nemotron-model`):

- `multilingual-1120ms` (default) — the Nemotron 3.5 multilingual build from
  the 2026-06-08 amendment, with the existing `nemotron-language` hint.
- `english-1120ms` — **Nemotron Speech Streaming EN 0.6B** (FastConformer-RNNT,
  ~600 MB CoreML download via `FluidInference/nemotron-speech-streaming-en-0.6b-coreml`,
  1120 ms chunk tier). English-only; it has no language-hint surface, so the
  stored `nemotron-language` is ignored while it is selected. Vendor-published
  benchmarks (M5 Pro: 2.28% WER / 65x RTFx at the 1120 ms tier, 100-file
  LibriSpeech subset) motivated surfacing it — see
  `docs/research/stt-models-and-voice-personalization-2026-06.md` §2.1 and
  roadmap item 2 (§9) (June 2026 STT research, currently on the
  `research/stt-models-voice-personalization` branch pending merge).

Scope notes: the EN build runs batch-at-stop through the streaming manager
(no live dictation partials in this amendment), exposes no word-level
timestamps or confidence scores (the established Nemotron posture), and only
the 1120 ms tier is surfaced. Build swaps follow the same scheduler guards as
Parakeet v2/v3 swaps (ADR-016). License posture: FluidAudio and its CoreML
conversion are Apache-2.0, but upstream NVIDIA model terms are not publicly
verifiable, so the model stays a user-triggered download — never bundled.

Both Nemotron builds remain Beta; fresh installs default to Parakeet v3.
Promotion criteria are unchanged: real MacParakeet corpus benchmarks
(dictation + meeting audio with corrected transcripts), not vendor numbers.
