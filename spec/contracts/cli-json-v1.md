# CLI JSON v1

> Status: ACTIVE - public automation contract for `macparakeet-cli`.

## Purpose

`macparakeet-cli` is the stable automation surface for local scripts, coding
agents, and external tools. JSON modes must remain machine-readable on stdout,
with human progress/status kept off stdout.

## Producers

- `CLIHelpers.printJSON`
- `CLIHelpers.printEnvelope`
- `CLIHelpers.emitJSONOrRethrow`
- Commands that expose JSON-on-stdout modes through `--json`, `--format json`,
  or `--envelope`
- `SpecCommand`

## Consumers

- Local shell scripts and `jq` pipelines.
- Coding-agent integrations.
- Smoke and support workflows.
- `integrations/README.md` users calling `macparakeet-cli` from outside this
  repo.

## Stable Conventions

- JSON payloads are written to stdout for the command's documented JSON stdout
  mode.
- Export-style commands can also write JSON files. For those commands,
  `--format json` alone may write a file and print the path; use the command's
  documented stdout mode from `macparakeet-cli spec --json` when a caller needs
  parseable JSON on stdout. For `meetings export`, that mode is
  `--stdout --format json`.
- Human progress/status is written to stderr.
- JSON uses ISO-8601 dates, sorted keys, and pretty printing through the shared
  encoder.
- `macparakeet-cli spec --json` is the machine-readable command catalog.
- `--envelope` success output uses `{ ok, command, data, meta }` and does not
  change an existing command's plain `--json` success shape.
- Commands that expose both `--json` and `--envelope` reject the combination.
- JSON object keys are camelCase. The one exception is the `transforms` family
  (`is_built_in`, `created_at`), which predates this convention; its keys are
  frozen for v1 and would only change at a major boundary. New commands use
  camelCase.

## Failure Envelope

After argument parsing succeeds, JSON-aware command failures emit this shape on
stdout:

- `ok`: always `false`
- `error`: human-readable message
- `errorType`: stable low-cardinality string
- `fix`: optional actionable hint
- `meta`: optional object with `schemaVersion`, `generatedAt`, and `warnings`

The process exit code remains the source of truth for branching. The envelope
explains why the command failed.

## Exit Codes

- `0`: success
- `1`: runtime failure after work was attempted
- `2`: validation or invocation misuse
- `130`: interrupted by SIGINT

Parse-time and `validate()` failures happen before command `run()` and may
surface through ArgumentParser's plain-text stderr path. Downstream automation
must check the exit code first and not require a JSON envelope for parse-time
misuse.

## Non-Stable Fields

- `meta.generatedAt` changes on every envelope.
- Human-readable `error` and `fix` copy can improve when `errorType` and exit
  code semantics stay stable.
- The command catalog can add commands, options, fields, and new `errorType`
  values in minor releases.

## Versioning And Compatibility

The current CLI spec schema is `macparakeet.cli.spec` v1. Additive catalog
fields are v1-compatible. Removing or renaming failure-envelope fields,
changing exit-code meanings, or moving JSON-mode status text to stdout is a
breaking contract change and requires explicit version/changelog treatment.

## Tests that enforce this

- `SpecCommandTests`
- `LLMJSONOutputTests`
- `MeetingsCommandTests`
- `MeetingVADSimCommandTests`
- `TranscribeCommandTests`
- `ConfigCommandTests`
- `QuickPromptsCommandTests`
- `TransformsCommandTests`
- `VocabCommandTests`

Focused coverage pins spec conventions, failure-envelope fields, exit code
entries, JSON wrapper failure envelopes, JSON validation exit-code
normalization, agent-facing meeting commands, command-level JSON failure
envelopes, and `--json`/`--envelope` mutual exclusion.

## When this changes

Update this file, `Sources/CLI/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/cli-testing.md`,
`integrations/README.md` if external callers are affected, and the focused CLI
tests in the same PR.
