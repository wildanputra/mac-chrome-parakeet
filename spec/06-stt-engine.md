# 06 - STT Engine

> Status: **ACTIVE** - Authoritative, current

MacParakeet's default speech engine family is Parakeet TDT 0.6B via FluidAudio CoreML on Apple's Neural Engine (ANE). Multilingual v3 is the default build; English-only v2 is an opt-in Parakeet build for users who want a faster no-auto-detect path; and an English-only Parakeet Unified build adds native streaming dictation with built-in punctuation, capitalization, and token-derived word timestamps. Nemotron is available as an opt-in Beta local engine (multilingual Nemotron 3.5 by default, plus an English-only second build), WhisperKit remains the mature optional fallback for languages Parakeet/Nemotron do not cover well enough, and Cohere Transcribe is an opt-in local accuracy engine for record-then-transcribe jobs. All speech engines run on-device; there is no cloud STT path.

## Speech Engines

### Parakeet Default

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Model | Parakeet TDT 0.6B (`v3` default, `v2` opt-in) |
| Runtime | FluidAudio SDK (CoreML on ANE) |
| Benchmark accuracy | Full-LibriSpeech macro WER: 3.22% (v3 multilingual), 2.57% (v2 English-only), 2.38% (Unified). FLEURS directional pass: v3 is strong on English but fails CJK/Korean by romanizing output. |
| Speed | Apple M4 Pro speed/memory micro-bench: ~81x realtime (v3), ~90x (v2), ~93x (Unified) steady RTFx |
| Peak working RAM | Apple M4 Pro speed/memory micro-bench: 131 MB (v3), 123 MB (v2), 115 MB (Unified) peak RSS, before recognition-time custom vocabulary boosting |
| Model download | ~465 MB CoreML bundle per build (one-time; v2 and v3 cache independently) |
| Output | Word-level timestamps with per-word confidence scores |
| Input format | 16kHz mono Float32 samples (FluidAudio's AudioConverter handles resampling) |
| Languages | v3: 25 European languages; v2: English only |
| Decoding | Optimized CTC/TDT decoding (FluidAudio implementation) |

#### Parakeet model variant (v2 / v3 / unified)

FluidAudio ships two peer Parakeet TDT 0.6B builds plus the newer Parakeet
Unified build, all exposed to the user as selectable Parakeet models:

| Variant | `ParakeetModelVariant` | Languages | Notes |
|---------|------------------------|-----------|-------|
| Multilingual (default) | `.v3` | English + 24 European | "Works for everyone"; the new-user default. |
| English-only | `.v2` | English only | A touch faster on English; cannot mis-detect English as another language (issues #311, #398). |
| English (Unified) | `.unified` | English only | NVIDIA Parakeet Unified EN 0.6B. Strong English accuracy with punctuation/capitalization. A *separate* FluidAudio runtime (`StreamingUnifiedAsrManager`, no `AsrModelVersion`); file/meeting/final dictation and live dictation preview use native `parakeet-unified-2080ms` streaming so final transcripts carry token-derived word timestamps for exports and speaker alignment. ~565 MB int8 per encoder export. Requires FluidAudio >= 0.15.4. Issues #520, #610. |

- **Preference:** persisted as a validated enum under `SpeechEnginePreference.parakeetModelVariantKey` (default `.v3`). The `ParakeetModelVariant → AsrModelVersion` bridge lives in `STT/ParakeetModelVariant+ASR.swift` so the preference type stays Foundation-only; it returns `nil` for `.unified` (which has no TDT version — see `usesUnifiedEngine`).
- **Runtime:** v2/v3 load the shared TDT `AsrManager`; `.unified` is routed to a dedicated `ParakeetUnifiedEngine` (wrapping FluidAudio's native `StreamingUnifiedAsrManager` for final transcription and live dictation), the same way the Nemotron engine routes its English build. `STTScheduler.setParakeetModelVariant(_:onProgress:)` reloads the active Parakeet model in place when Parakeet is selected — downloading the target build before releasing the current one, restoring the previous build if the final load fails. It shares the engine-switch guard, so it is blocked while transcription, a meeting lease, or an engine switch is in flight. Builds cache independently, so flipping between two installed builds is near-instant.
- **GUI:** the *Parakeet Model* card under Settings → Engine (shown only when Parakeet is the active engine, symmetric to the Whisper Language card).
- **CLI:** `config set parakeet-model v3|v2|unified` (aliases `multilingual`/`english`/`english-unified`), `transcribe --parakeet-model app-default|v3|v2|unified`, and the `parakeet-v3` / `parakeet-v2` / `parakeet-unified` ids in `models list` / `models select`.

### Nemotron Beta Engine

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Model | Nemotron 3.5 ASR Streaming 0.6B (`multilingual-1120ms`, default) / Nemotron Speech Streaming EN 0.6B (`english-1120ms`, English-only, ~600 MB) |
| Runtime | FluidAudio streaming Nemotron CoreML path |
| Model cache | FluidAudio model cache under `~/Library/Application Support/FluidAudio/Models/` |
| Output | Text, token-derived word timestamps when FluidAudio reports token timings, and detected/specified language when reported |
| Languages | Multilingual build: 40 language-locales upstream; English build: English only (ignores the `nemotron-language` hint); both exposed as opt-in Beta while MacParakeet benchmarks quality on real product audio |
| Selection | Explicit in Settings or CLI (`--engine nemotron --language <code>`); build via the Settings *Nemotron Model* card, `config set nemotron-model`, or `transcribe --nemotron-model`; no automatic fallback |
| Download | ~1.5 GB (multilingual) / ~600 MB (English), explicit Settings/CLI download before selecting as the shared default |

Nemotron is shipped as Beta because it is fast and local but not yet proven as a default replacement on MacParakeet's real dictation/meeting corpus. It enters the same scheduler/runtime control plane as the Parakeet family and WhisperKit rather than creating a feature-owned ASR stack.

Because Nemotron is a streaming engine, dictation on **both** Nemotron builds (multilingual and English) streams microphone samples into a live session: partial text appears in the dictation overlay while speaking, and the streamed final transcript is used as the dictation result. (File and meeting jobs on Nemotron still run batch-at-stop.) The recorded WAV is still always written; if the live session cannot start, fails mid-stream, drops samples under backpressure, or finishes empty, dictation transparently falls back to transcribing the recorded file (this fallback is within the Nemotron path — it is not an engine fallback, which remains explicitly user-selected per the table above).

**Display-only live dictation preview.** Separately from the final paste path, an opt-in display-only preview (`AppFeatures.liveDictationStreamingEnabled`, #517) renders a stable rolling readout of in-progress text above the dictation pill. It never feeds the paste — the final inserted text always comes from the stop-time transcription path. Parakeet v2/v3 use a single-flight tail-window batch preview (reusing their `[Float]` batch path), Parakeet Unified uses FluidAudio's native `StreamingUnifiedAsrManager` (`parakeet-unified-2080ms`), the Nemotron builds reuse their native live partials, Whisper stays default-off pending a per-pass latency probe, and Cohere stays off because it is batch-only. A per-session `LiveTranscriptStabilizer` turns the raw stream into a monotonic, append-only readout (settled body committed, last few words held as a volatile hypothesis) so shown words don't jump or disappear; the overlay renders it bottom-anchored with older lines fading out at the top edge (no mid-word truncation). Full behavior and lifecycle (single-flight/native session ownership, cancel/drain, engine-switch and shutdown ordering) are specified in `spec/05-audio-pipeline.md` → "Dictation Live Preview" and `docs/research/live-dictation-streaming.md`.

### WhisperKit Optional Engine

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Model | Whisper large-v3 turbo CoreML variant by default (`large-v3-v20240930_turbo_632MB`) |
| Runtime | WhisperKit (`argmaxinc/argmax-oss-swift`, exact 0.18.0 when enabled) |
| Model cache | `~/Library/Application Support/MacParakeet/models/stt/whisper/` |
| Output | Text, word timestamps when available, detected language when reported |
| Languages | Broad Whisper language coverage, including Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Hindi, Arabic, and others outside Parakeet v3 coverage |
| Selection | Explicit in Settings or CLI (`--engine whisper --language <code>`); no automatic fallback |

Parakeet remains the default because it is faster, lower-latency, and lower-memory for supported languages. Nemotron is the faster experimental path (multilingual default build, English-only opt-in build); WhisperKit solves mature broad coverage while preserving the local-first speech boundary.

### Cohere Transcribe Optional Engine

Cohere Transcribe (`cohere-transcribe-03-2026`, 2B, Apache-2.0) was evaluated by the gold-standard benchmark (`benchmarks/asr/`, PR #568) and is shipped as an opt-in local engine for accuracy-critical record-then-transcribe work. It runs on-device through the same FluidAudio CoreML SDK as Parakeet/Nemotron — FluidAudio >= 0.15.4 exposes a public `CoherePipeline`; q8 model repo `FluidInference/cohere-transcribe-03-2026-coreml` — so no MLX or new runtime is required, unlike the deferred MLX-only candidates (Qwen3-ASR, Moonshine).

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Status | Shipped opt-in local engine; not the default |
| Runtime | FluidAudio `CoherePipeline` through `CohereTranscribeEngine` |
| Model cache | `~/Library/Application Support/FluidAudio/Models/cohere-transcribe/q8` |
| Accuracy | Most accurate on-device: English macro WER 2.07% (full LibriSpeech); best Japanese (FLEURS CER 5.56). Significant lead only on noisy English + Japanese; clean EN/KO/ZH are statistical ties (paired-bootstrap CIs) |
| Output | Plain transcript text; no word timestamps, no speaker labels, no live partials |
| Selection | Explicit in Settings or CLI (`--engine cohere --language <code>`); `models select cohere-transcribe`; no automatic fallback |
| Download | ~2.1 GB, explicit Settings/CLI download (`models download cohere-transcribe`) before selection or transcription; normal transcription paths fail fast if the model is missing |
| Compute | Defaults to Core ML CPU+Neural Engine (`ane`) to avoid the recurring per-launch GPU specialization cost. A Settings control (shown when Cohere is active) and the `cohereComputePolicy` default let users opt into GPU for faster warm latency; the change applies on the next Cohere load (relaunch) |

Cohere is batch-only and single-flight inside the shared runtime. Dictation records first and transcribes after the user stops; it does not show live dictation preview. File transcription and meeting finalization can use Cohere, but meeting live preview chunks are disabled and meeting transcripts degrade to plain text because Cohere does not emit word timestamps. `STTScheduler` treats Cohere as a global serialized resource so an interactive Cohere dictation finalization is not hidden behind an engine-internal wait while another Cohere batch job is running; Parakeet and Nemotron keep the normal interactive/background split for low-latency dictation. Parakeet v3 stays the default and WhisperKit remains the lighter broad-coverage option; Cohere is for users who explicitly accept the larger model and memory footprint for accuracy. Full benchmark methodology, CIs, and speed/memory tables: `benchmarks/asr/README.md`.

### Three-Chip Architecture

Each ML workload runs on the chip it was designed for:

```
CPU:  MacParakeet app (UI, shortcuts, clipboard, history)
ANE/CoreML: Parakeet STT, Nemotron Beta, and Cohere Transcribe (via FluidAudio/CoreML)
CPU/GPU/CoreML as selected by WhisperKit: optional multilingual STT
```

The default Parakeet path runs on dedicated silicon, leaving CPU and GPU free for the app and macOS. Nemotron uses FluidAudio's CoreML path with separate interactive/background managers backed by shared model weights. Cohere uses FluidAudio's CoreML batch path and is admitted as a scheduler-level single-flight resource around its loaded pipeline. WhisperKit uses the compute path selected by WhisperKit/CoreML for the downloaded model variant.

## FluidAudio SDK

### Overview

[FluidAudio](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio) is an open-source Swift SDK by FluidInference that runs Parakeet TDT on Apple's Neural Engine via CoreML. It is Apache 2.0 licensed and is the active runtime integration point for MacParakeet's default STT path.

**SwiftPM dependency:** Use the `FluidAudio` product only — NOT `FluidAudioEspeak` (GPL-3.0, includes Kokoro TTS via ESpeakNG). PocketTTS (GPL-free) is already included in the core `FluidAudio` product since v0.12.0.

### API Surface

Transcription in native Swift async/await:

```swift
import FluidAudio

let selectedVersion: AsrModelVersion = .v3 // or .v2 for English-only
let models = try await AsrModels.downloadAndLoad(version: selectedVersion)
let manager = AsrManager(config: .default)
try await manager.initialize(models: models)

let result = try await manager.transcribe(samples, source: .system)
// result.text — full transcription
// result.confidence — e.g. 0.988
// result.tokenTimings — word-level timestamps with per-word confidence
```

### Audio Input

All methods require 16kHz mono Float32 samples. FluidAudio provides `AudioConverter`:

```swift
// From audio file (WAV, M4A, etc.)
let samples = try await AudioConverter.resampleAudioFile(path: "path.wav")

// From AVAudioPCMBuffer (microphone capture)
let samples = try AudioConverter.resampleBuffer(buffer)
```

**Critical:** Always use FluidAudio's `AudioConverter` — never manually decode audio. CoreML models require correctly resampled input; manual parsing silently corrupts it.

For meeting recording specifically, this has an important consequence: the saved `meeting-playback.m4a` artifact may preserve microphone/system channel separation as stereo, but the current final Parakeet path still works on mono per-source WAVs. MacParakeet avoids collapsing the final meeting path to a single mono mix by transcribing `microphone-raw.m4a` and `system-raw.m4a` separately, then merging those fresh results with persisted source-alignment metadata. See `docs/research/meeting-dual-stream-transcription-pipeline.md` for the end-to-end meeting pipeline.

### Custom Vocabulary Boosting (v0.11.0+)

MacParakeet Phase 1 uses FluidAudio's 110M CTC encoder as a post-TDT
recognition sidecar, not as a replacement ASR runtime. The normal Parakeet TDT
decode runs first and returns transcript text plus token timings; when
recognition boosting is supported and there are enabled vocabulary anchors,
MacParakeet runs the CTC sidecar over the same audio samples and uses
`VocabularyRescorer` to produce the final transcript text.

Source of truth:

- Enabled `CustomWord` rows with `replacement == nil` or blank replacement
  become recognition-time vocabulary anchors.
- Enabled rows with nonblank `replacement` remain deterministic
  post-transcription corrections/backstops.
- Disabled rows and terms shorter than `minTermLength` (`3`) are ignored by
  recognition boosting.

Support matrix:

| Engine / variant | Recognition boosting |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Parakeet TDT `v3` | Yes |
| Parakeet TDT `v2` | Yes |
| Parakeet Unified | No |
| Nemotron | No |
| WhisperKit | No |
| Cohere Transcribe | No |

Runtime behavior:

- Empty vocabulary or unsupported engine variants take the byte-for-byte
  previous path: no CTC model download/load and no added latency.
- The CTC model is lazy-loaded from FluidAudio's Application Support model
  cache only when boosting is needed; download/load/rescoring failures degrade
  to the unboosted transcript and log only content-free diagnostics.
- Vocabulary tokenization is cached by stable content hash and refreshed when
  the effective anchor set changes.
- Product constants live in `CustomVocabularyBoostingConfiguration`:
  `minSimilarity = 0.65`, `minTermLength = 3`, and FluidAudio's size-aware
  rescoring defaults otherwise.
- Dictation sidecar audio uses the same 16 kHz samples sent to TDT, including
  the 0.5 second trailing-silence pad from issue #562. File and meeting
  finalization keep the URL/disk-backed TDT path; Phase 1 only sidecars short
  audio that can be loaded under the configured sidecar sample bound, and skips
  boosting for longer jobs until chunked sidecar rescoring lands.
- Vocabulary contents are user data. MacParakeet does not log or emit telemetry
  with the term strings.

When active, peak working RAM is the Parakeet TDT slot plus the CTC sidecar. The
published speed/memory benchmark currently measures the non-boosted Parakeet
paths at 115-131 MB peak RSS on an M4 Pro; rerun a representative boosted-vocab
case before publishing a boosted-memory number. The intended term count remains
small user vocabularies rather than full dictionaries.

### Additional Capabilities (via FluidAudio)

| Capability | Model | Details |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Streaming ASR | Parakeet EOU 1.1B | Real-time with end-of-utterance detection, 160ms-1600ms chunks |
| Speaker diarization (offline) | Pyannote community-1 + WeSpeaker v2 + VBx clustering | ~15% DER (VoxConverse, CoreML), ~130 MB models, unlimited speakers. See ADR-010. |
| Speaker diarization (streaming) | Sortformer (NVIDIA) | ~32% DER, 4 speaker max. Not used — see ADR-010 for rationale. |
| Voice activity detection | Silero | 96% accuracy, 1220x RTF |
| Custom vocabulary | CTC/TDT keyword boosting | 110M sidecar for Parakeet TDT v2/v3 enabled anchors |

**Note:** ASR (Parakeet TDT) and diarization (pyannote/WeSpeaker) are entirely separate model pipelines. Parakeet does NOT include diarization. Both are bundled in the FluidAudio SDK — no additional dependencies needed.

> **Dependency surface (not shipped):** the pinned FluidAudio also exposes
> streaming diarizers (`LSEENDDiarizer`, `SortformerDiarizer`) and
> speaker-enrollment APIs. MacParakeet ships none of these — offline batch is
> the only diarizer it uses. They are surveyed as a *future* tentative-live /

## STT Integration

### Protocol Layer

The producer-facing STT contract was expanded in ADR-016 so callers declare job type explicitly and runtime lifecycle stays on the shared path:

```swift
public enum STTJobKind: Sendable, Equatable {
    case dictation
    case meetingFinalize
    case meetingLiveChunk
    case fileTranscription
}

public enum STTWarmUpState: Sendable, Equatable {
    case idle
    case working(message: String, progress: Double?)
    case ready
    case failed(message: String)
}

public protocol STTTranscribing: Sendable {
    func transcribe(
        audioPath: String,
        job: STTJobKind,
        onProgress: (@Sendable (Int, Int) -> Void)?
    ) async throws -> STTResult
}

public protocol SpeechEngineRoutedTranscribing: STTTranscribing {
    func transcribe(
        audioPath: String,
        job: STTJobKind,
        speechEngine: SpeechEngineSelection,
        onProgress: (@Sendable (Int, Int) -> Void)?
    ) async throws -> STTResult
}

public protocol STTRuntimeManaging: Sendable {
    func warmUp(onProgress: (@Sendable (String) -> Void)?) async throws
    func backgroundWarmUp() async
    func observeWarmUpProgress() async -> (id: UUID, stream: AsyncStream<STTWarmUpState>)
    func removeWarmUpObserver(id: UUID) async
    func isReady() async -> Bool
    func clearModelCache() async
    func shutdown() async
}

public typealias STTManaging = STTTranscribing & STTRuntimeManaging
public typealias STTClientProtocol = STTManaging

public enum SpeechEnginePreference: String, CaseIterable, Codable, Sendable {
    case parakeet
    case nemotron
    case whisper
    case cohere
}

public struct SpeechEngineSelection: Codable, Equatable, Sendable {
    let engine: SpeechEnginePreference
    let language: String?  // Whisper/Nemotron hint, or Cohere's required language; nil means engine default/auto where supported
}

public struct SpeechEngineLease: Equatable, Sendable {
    let id: UUID
    let selection: SpeechEngineSelection
}

public protocol SpeechEngineSwitching: Sendable {
    func setSpeechEngine(_ preference: SpeechEnginePreference) async throws
}

public protocol SpeechEngineSessionManaging: Sendable {
    func beginSpeechEngineSession() async -> SpeechEngineLease
    func endSpeechEngineSession(_ lease: SpeechEngineLease) async
}

struct STTResult: Sendable {
    let text: String
    let words: [TimestampedWord]
    let language: String?
}

struct TimestampedWord: Sendable {
    let word: String
    let startMs: Int          // milliseconds
    let endMs: Int            // milliseconds
    let confidence: Double
}
```

### Runtime and Scheduling

ADR-016 defines MacParakeet's STT architecture as:

- **One process-wide `STTRuntime` owner** for model lifecycle and warm-up/shutdown across Parakeet, Nemotron Beta, Cohere, and optional WhisperKit
- **Two STT execution slots by default**
  - an **interactive slot** reserved for `dictation`
  - a **background slot** shared by `meetingFinalize`, `meetingLiveChunk`, and `fileTranscription`
- **One STT scheduler / control plane** owning admission, slot assignment, priority, backpressure, cancellation, and job-scoped progress
- **Many producers** (`DictationService`, `MeetingRecordingService`, `TranscriptionService`) submitting jobs into the scheduler
- **Explicit speech-engine routing** through `SpeechEngineSelection` when a caller needs a pinned engine/language

The app does not treat "one service = one STT runtime" as a valid long-term architecture.
`STTClient` remains only as a standalone compatibility facade for the CLI and tests; app code uses the shared `STTRuntime` + `STTScheduler` from `AppEnvironment`.
The GUI uses `speechRecognitionEngine` as **Live Speech** for dictation and
eligible meeting preview. `transcriptionSpeechRecognitionEngine` is the
optional **Final Transcription** override for authoritative post-meeting STT and
file, media, URL, podcast, and retranscription jobs. When the latter key is
absent, final work inherits Live Speech; Settings must preserve absence rather
than materializing a duplicate value. This is a routing-policy layer on top of
the shared control plane, not a separate runtime per feature. The CLI can still
override per invocation.

The first live/final build runs a one-shot preference repair for development
profiles that opened Settings during the brief feature-grouped split: an
equal-valued transcription key is removed because that build materialized it
without user intent. A different value is preserved. After the repair flag is
set, an explicitly enabled equal-valued override remains durable as intended.

### Lifecycle

- **Lazy init**: The shared runtime owner is not loaded at app launch; loaded on first STT request or warm-up
- **Keep loaded**: Once initialized, the runtime keeps its currently loaded managers ready for subsequent requests
- **Warm-up during onboarding**: Prepare the default Parakeet build (~465 MB) + CoreML compilation (~3.4s first time) on the default path; for Korean, Japanese, Chinese, or Cantonese macOS languages, onboarding prepares Whisper instead and stores the matching Whisper language hint locally
- **Graceful shutdown**: The shared runtime is released when the app quits
- **Single owner**: Warm-up, readiness, shutdown, and cache clear happen once at the runtime layer
- **Cancellation-safe init**: Shutdown/cache clear cancel in-flight initialization and wait for loaded managers to clean themselves up before returning
- **Meeting speech plan**: Meeting recording leases Live Speech at start unconditionally and captures `MeetingSpeechPlan { preview?, final }`; engine/model changes and model deletion are rejected while the lease is active. Preview uses the lease only when word-timing capabilities support the renderer. Final loads lazily after durable stop through the normal scheduler route.

### Scheduling Policy

The scheduler exists because local STT is a scarce interactive resource even when audio capture is concurrent.

Default policy:

1. **Interactive slot**: reserved for `dictation`
2. **Background slot**: shared by `meetingFinalize`, `meetingLiveChunk`, and `fileTranscription`

Priority within the background slot:

1. `meetingFinalize`
2. `meetingLiveChunk`
3. `fileTranscription`

Backpressure and queueing rules:

- Meeting live chunks are best-effort and may be dropped under backlog
- When a meeting stops, queued live-preview work may be cancelled/dropped so `meetingFinalize` runs next
- Meeting finalization uses `meetingFinalize` both immediately after stop and for archived meeting retranscribes when `meeting-recording-metadata.json` is available
- Meeting rows without archived source metadata fall back to `fileTranscription` on the stored `transcriptions.filePath` audio
- Dictation must not be queued behind meeting or batch work
- File transcription is intentionally queued and single-job in v1; a running long batch job may delay meeting STT on the background slot
- Back-to-back meeting recording does not add a second ASR lane. The meeting
  stop path returns the recorder to idle after durable audio, lock, and
  Library-row materialization; the queued final STT still waits for any
  currently running `fileTranscription` job, then `meetingFinalize` priority
  puts it ahead of later queued file work
- Long-running batch work should be segmented into bounded work units in a future iteration if we want it to yield more gracefully
- Progress reporting must be fanned out per job, not broadcast globally from the raw runtime stream
- Cancellation is checked before scheduler admission so fast user cancels do not race into successful transcriptions
- Speaker diarization remains a separate service and is not part of the two-slot speech scheduler
- Switching Parakeet/Nemotron/Cohere/Whisper is rejected while jobs are queued/running or a meeting speech-engine lease is active

### Data Flow

```
Dictation:
  AudioRecorder → temp WAV → STTScheduler.transcribe(audioPath:, job: .dictation, onProgress:) → selected local engine → STTResult

File transcription (v0.4+):
  FFmpeg (video demux) → .wav → STTScheduler.transcribe(audioPath:, job: .fileTranscription, onProgress:) → queued background-slot selected-engine STTResult
                                                                                                             → OfflineDiarizerManager.process() → DiarizationResult
                                                                                                             → Merge word timestamps + speaker segments

YouTube (v0.4+):
  yt-dlp → .m4a → FFmpeg → .wav → STTScheduler.transcribe(audioPath:, job: .fileTranscription, onProgress:) → queued background-slot selected-engine STTResult
                                                                                                        → OfflineDiarizerManager.process() → DiarizationResult
                                                                                                        → Merge word timestamps + speaker segments

  Download and metadata extraction happen before STT admission. Only the
  post-download `.fileTranscription` job contends with meeting finalization.

Meeting live preview (v0.6):
  MicrophoneCapture (raw default)/SystemAudioStream
    → CaptureOrchestrator (paired frames + bounded lag + chunking)
    → MicConditioner (pass-through; no capture-time AEC by default)
    → dominant-system live guard (skip clearly system-dominant mic chunks for live preview only)
    → LiveChunkTranscriber (queueing + ordering + cancellation)
    → STTScheduler.transcribe(audioPath:, job: .meetingLiveChunk, speechEngine: meetingPlan.preview, onProgress:)
    → background-slot selected-engine STT
    → live transcript update

Meeting stop / finalization:
  microphone-raw.m4a + system-raw.m4a + MeetingSourceAlignment
    → convert each source to mono WAV
    → STTScheduler.transcribe(audioPath:, job: .meetingFinalize, speechEngine: meetingPlan.final, onProgress:) per source
    → aligned merge
    → final saved meeting transcript

Saved meeting retranscription from the library:
  meeting-playback.m4a + archived meeting-recording-metadata.json + source files
    → reconstruct MeetingRecordingOutput
    → same dual-source meetingFinalize path and captured final engine as immediate post-stop finalization
    → updated meeting transcript
  Stored-file fallback:
    transcriptions.filePath audio only → .wav → STTScheduler.transcribe(audioPath:, job: .fileTranscription, onProgress:) → queued background-slot STT → updated meeting transcript
```

## Model Distribution

### Parakeet CoreML Model Bundle

The `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-*-coreml` HuggingFace repos host several precision/encoder variants, but MacParakeet only fetches the components it loads for the selected build, so the **actual download is ~465 MB per build**. v2 and v3 cache independently, so a user who installs both pays the ~465 MB once each:

| Component | Format |
|-----------|--------|
| ParakeetEncoder (int8 for selected build) | `.mlmodelc` |
| Decoder | `.mlmodelc` |

### Parakeet Download Mechanism

- `AsrModels.downloadAndLoad(version:)` checks local cache first
- If not cached, downloads from HuggingFace (configurable via `ModelRegistry.baseURL`)
- CoreML compilation: ~3.4s cold (first load), ~162ms warm (subsequent loads)
- After first run, models load from local cache

### Nemotron Model Download

Nemotron is downloaded from an explicit Settings/CLI action. It is not part of first-run onboarding and is not selected automatically from locale.

```bash
swift run macparakeet-cli models download nemotron-multilingual-1120ms
swift run macparakeet-cli models download nemotron-english-1120ms
```

The surfaced variants are `NemotronModelVariant.multilingual1120` (`multilingual-1120ms`, default) and `NemotronModelVariant.english1120` (`english-1120ms`, Nemotron Speech Streaming EN 0.6B, English-only). The build preference is stored as `nemotron-model` (`config set nemotron-model multilingual-1120ms|english-1120ms`, aliases `multilingual`/`english`) and can be overridden per run via `transcribe --nemotron-model app-default|multilingual-1120ms|english-1120ms`. The optional language hint is stored separately as `nemotron-language` and applies only to the multilingual build (the English build ignores it); `auto` clears the stored hint.

### Whisper Model Download

Whisper models are downloaded from an explicit Settings/CLI action, or during first-run onboarding when the local macOS language is Korean, Japanese, Chinese, or Cantonese. That first-run branch is an initial setup choice, not automatic fallback during transcription.

```bash
swift run macparakeet-cli models download whisper-large-v3-v20240930-turbo-632MB
```

The normalized Whisper variant is stored without the leading `whisper-` prefix in preferences; model files live under `AppPaths.whisperModelsDir`.

### First-Run Experience

During onboarding:

1. Use local macOS preferred languages to choose the initial speech setup path.
2. Default path: download the default Parakeet CoreML build (~465 MB) with progress indication.
3. CJK path: download the default Whisper model (~632 MB), save the canonical Whisper language hint (`ko`, `ja`, `zh`, or `yue`), and switch the app default engine to Whisper through the scheduler.
4. If speaker detection is enabled, prepare diarization assets (~130 MB) on the separate diarization service path.
5. Warm the selected runtime path enough to verify the chosen engine works.

Onboarding should not report the speech stack as ready until the runtime owner is ready **and** any required default-on speaker-detection assets are available.
Whisper readiness is separate on the default Parakeet path, but it is first-run readiness on the locale-aware CJK path.

This replaces the previous Python venv bootstrap (~500 MB deps + ~2.5 GB model).

## Error Handling

### Model Download

- Show download progress bar in the UI
- Support retry on network failure
- Resume partial downloads where possible (HuggingFace supports range requests)
- Verify model integrity after download where the provider exposes enough metadata
- If the Nemotron, Cohere, or Whisper model is missing, keep Parakeet usable and direct the user to the explicit model download action

### CoreML Errors

- CoreML runs in-process (not a separate daemon) — no subprocess crash isolation
- Wrap transcription calls in error handling
- On CoreML failure, log the error, report to user, allow retry
- Memory pressure: the current M4 Pro benchmark measures Parakeet builds at 115-131 MB peak RSS in the isolated CLI speed/memory harness, far less likely to trigger OOM than the previous ~2 GB MLX path. Cohere is the exceptional opt-in batch engine and is budgeted separately.

### Engine Switching Errors

- Engine changes are refused while scheduler jobs are queued or running.
- Engine changes are refused while a meeting recording holds a speech-engine lease.
- The UI should surface this as an actionable busy state rather than silently changing preferences.

### Timeout Handling

- Transcription requests have a timeout proportional to audio duration
- Short dictations: 30-second timeout
- Long files: generous timeout (Parakeet builds measured ~81-93x steady RTFx on the current M4 Pro benchmark; other engines vary by model)
- Warm-up/model download allows a longer timeout (first-run downloads can take minutes)

## Performance

| Scenario | Current benchmark evidence |
|----------|----------------------------|
| Parakeet cold start | 0.38 s (v3), 0.55 s (v2), 0.93 s (Unified) in the Apple M4 Pro speed/memory micro-bench |
| Short dictation (5-10 seconds audio) | Usually sub-100ms STT work once the selected Parakeet build is ready |
| Long file transcription | Parakeet v3/v2/Unified measured ~81-93x steady RTFx, roughly 39-44 seconds per hour of audio before I/O and post-processing overhead |
| Optional engines | Nemotron measured ~57-61x, Whisper ~14x, and Cohere ~11x with a ~73 s cold start and ~11.6 GB peak RSS in the committed reference row |

These figures are Apple M4 Pro benchmark evidence from `benchmarks/asr/`, not universal latency promises. WhisperKit exists for language coverage and should not be described as matching Parakeet latency. Cohere exists for accuracy-critical batch work and should not be described as matching Parakeet memory or cold-start behavior.

### Speed Comparison

| Audio length | Parakeet v3 at ~81x steady RTFx | Perceptible? |
|-------------|------------------------------|-------------|
| 5 seconds | ~0.06 s | No |
| 30 seconds | ~0.37 s | No |
| 1 minute | ~0.74 s | Barely |
| 5 minutes | ~3.7 s | Yes |
| 1 hour | ~44 s | Yes, but still fast |

For dictation (the primary use case), transcription time is imperceptible. For long file transcription, the ANE path is still remarkably fast.

### Memory Budget

- Parakeet STT: 115-131 MB peak RSS in the non-boosted M4 Pro speed/memory benchmark, depending on build
- Recognition-time custom vocabulary boosting: adds the CTC sidecar; benchmark a representative boosted-vocab case before publishing a boosted memory number
- Cohere Transcribe: ~11.6 GB peak RSS in the committed speed/memory reference row; treat it as a 16 GB+ opt-in batch engine
- App process (UI + services): ~100 MB
- Audio buffers: ~50 MB
- Illustrative warm single-slot budget: ~200-250 MB before diarization
- Real total memory depends on how many STT managers/slots are loaded and active, whether background capacity stays lazy in the final two-slot design, and whether diarization models are also resident
- Recommended baseline: 8 GB RAM (Apple Silicon)

### Optimization Notes

- The shared runtime owner keeps its managers initialized after first use — subsequent calls skip model loading
- Apple Silicon's unified memory means no CPU↔ANE transfer overhead
- For dictation, latency is the primary concern — sub-100ms after warm-up
- For file transcription, throughput matters more — it is intentionally lower-priority than dictation and meeting work in the shared background slot
- The approved two-slot design assumes background capacity is a policy choice rather than a guaranteed always-hot third executor; benchmark any stronger concurrency claim before documenting it as fixed
- ANE and GPU run simultaneously — STT never competes with LLM for processing cycles

## Speaker Diarization (v0.4)

> See [ADR-010](adr/010-speaker-diarization.md) for the full decision record.

Speaker diarization ("who spoke when") uses FluidAudio's **offline diarization pipeline**, which is entirely separate from ASR. It applies to file and YouTube transcription, and may refine the isolated system side of a finalized meeting. It does not apply to dictation.

### Pipeline

Three-stage pipeline, all via FluidAudio's `OfflineDiarizerManager`:

```
Audio → Pyannote community-1 (WHEN) → WeSpeaker v2 (WHO) → VBx clustering (GROUP) → Speaker segments
```

1. **Segmentation** (Pyannote community-1): Powerset segmentation detects speech/silence boundaries and speaker changes at frame level
2. **Embedding extraction** (WeSpeaker v2): Produces 256-dim voice fingerprints for each speech segment
3. **Clustering** (VBx + AHC warm start): Groups embeddings by voice similarity to assign consistent speaker IDs

### Models

| Component | Model | Size | License |
|-----------|-------|------|---------|
| Segmentation | Pyannote community-1 (powerset) | ~50 MB | CC-BY-4.0 |
| Filter bank | Fbank feature extractor | ~1 MB | Apache 2.0 |
| Embeddings | WeSpeaker v2 (256-dim) | ~40 MB | Apache 2.0 |
| PLDA scoring | PLDA rho model + psi parameters | ~10 MB | Apache 2.0 |

**Total**: ~130 MB (one-time download, cached at `~/Library/Application Support/FluidAudio/Models/`)

### Integration with ASR

ASR and diarization run on the same audio, then results are merged:

```
Audio file
  ├─→ selected ASR engine                    → word timestamps + text
  └─→ OfflineDiarizerManager.process()        → speaker segments + IDs
                    ↓
         Merge by time overlap
                    ↓
         WordTimestamp entries with speakerId
```

Each word's time range is compared against diarization speaker segments. The speaker with the most overlap is assigned to that word. Words in silence gaps or overlapping speech zones (trimmed by the offline pipeline) get `speakerId = nil`.

**Diarization is non-fatal.** If diarization fails (`noSpeechDetected`, model error, etc.), the ASR result is still persisted. Speaker fields remain nil and the transcript displays without speaker attribution.

### API

```swift
let config = OfflineDiarizerConfig()
let manager = OfflineDiarizerManager(config: config)
try await manager.prepareModels()

let result = try await manager.process(url)
for segment in result.segments {
    // segment.speakerId — e.g. "speaker_0", "speaker_1" (FluidAudio format; DiarizationService normalizes to "S1", "S2")
    // segment.startTimeSeconds, segment.endTimeSeconds
}
```

### Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| DER (VoxConverse) | ~15% |
| DER (AMI) | ~17.7% |
| Speed | 64-122x RTF (config-dependent) |
| Memory | ~100 MB models + minimal working RAM |
| 1 hour audio | ~30-56 seconds processing |
| Total (ASR + diarization) | ~53-79 seconds per hour of audio |

### What's NOT included

- **No streaming diarization** — file transcription is batch, no need for real-time
- **No Sortformer** — 4-speaker hard limit and 32% DER (see ADR-010)
- **No cross-file speaker identity** — Speaker 1 in file A is not linked to Speaker 1 in file B
- **No dictation diarization** — single speaker by design
