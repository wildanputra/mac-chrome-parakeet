# MacParakeet Spec Index

> Status: **ACTIVE** - Authoritative, current
> Runtime Note: FluidAudio CoreML is the active architecture. Core STT is local; LLM provider use is opt-in, telemetry/crash reporting is opt-out, and a fully local setup is supported by disabling telemetry and using only local features/providers.

**MacParakeet** is a voice toolkit for macOS with on-device STT, optional AI and telemetry features, and support for a fully local setup.

## Root Decisions (Locked)

These decisions are final. Do not second-guess them.

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Local STT | Parakeet TDT 0.6B-v3 via FluidAudio CoreML/ANE by default; WhisperKit optional | Parakeet gives 155x realtime and low RAM for supported languages; Whisper adds broad multilingual coverage locally |
| Database | SQLite via GRDB | Single file, embedded, zero config |
| Platform | macOS 14.2+ (Apple Silicon only) | FluidAudio requires Apple Silicon; Swift 6.0 |
| Business model | Current public build free/GPL/unlocked; official paid distribution/support remains possible | Originally $49 one-time (ADR-003), went free with open-source release in v0.5; retained purchase activation plumbing is future-option code |

- [x] Plain-noun tab strip with one ambient indicator (ADR-020 §1, amended 2026-05-02): `Notes`, `Transcript`, `Ask` plus a breathing dot on Ask while `chatViewModel.isStreaming`; `ViewThatFits` collapses the dot into the tooltip at the 360px floor
- [x] Rich pre-meeting countdown toast for calendar starts (ADR-020): attendees + service icon row + steering hint pointing the user at the Notes tab. Manual-trigger toasts unchanged

- [x] WhisperKit dependency and `WhisperEngine` wrapper with local model cache at `~/Library/Application Support/MacParakeet/models/stt/whisper/`
- [x] `SpeechEnginePreference` and `SpeechEngineSelection` persisted through `UserDefaults`
- [x] Settings → Speech Recognition segmented engine picker plus Whisper language picker
- [x] Engine switching blocked while jobs are queued/running or a meeting speech-engine lease is active
- [x] CLI `transcribe --engine parakeet|whisper --language <code>` and `models download whisper-large-v3-v20240930-turbo-632MB`
- [x] Meeting recordings capture the active engine/language at start and preserve it through metadata, lock files, crash recovery, and final transcription

## For AI Coding Assistants

### Key Rules

1. **Specs are authoritative.** If code and spec disagree, the spec is correct (then fix the code).
2. **ADRs are locked.** Do not propose alternatives to locked decisions.
3. **Version order matters.** Implement v0.1 before v0.2. Do not jump ahead.
4. **Never lose user data.** Graceful degradation over silent failure.
5. **Local-first.** Audio stays on-device for STT. Optional AI sends transcript text only to the user-configured provider or CLI tool. Telemetry is opt-out and self-hosted.
6. **`swift test` is the gate.** All tests must pass before and after changes.
7. **Kernel is supporting context.** `spec/kernel/requirements.yaml` is a compact feature/status index, and `spec/kernel/traceability.md` maps features to source and tests. ADRs and narrative specs stay higher precedence.

### Where to Start

1. Read this file (you're here)
2. Read `CLAUDE.md` in the project root for build instructions and codebase patterns
3. Check `plans/active/` for in-progress work
4. Check the version progress above for what needs doing next
