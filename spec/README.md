# MacParakeet Spec Index

> Status: **ACTIVE** - Authoritative, current
> Runtime Note: FluidAudio CoreML is the active architecture. Core STT is local; LLM provider use is opt-in, telemetry/crash reporting is opt-out, and a fully local setup is supported by disabling telemetry and using only local features/providers.

**MacParakeet** is a voice toolkit for macOS with on-device STT, optional AI and telemetry features, and support for a fully local setup.

## Boundary Contracts

[`spec/contracts/`](contracts/) is the canonical home for tested public and
semi-public boundaries such as meeting artifact folders, recovery/retention
safety, and CLI JSON output. Update the matching contract doc and focused tests
when changing one of those surfaces.

## Design References

- [UI Patterns](04-ui-patterns.md) is the active product UI contract.
- [`docs/brand-identity.md`](../docs/brand-identity.md) is the active runtime
  brand identity reference: canonical parakeet mark, app accent color, sizing,
  and usage rules.
- [`brand-assets/README.md`](../brand-assets/README.md) is the active
  promotional/editorial asset library: recolorable vector mark, Pop palette,
  composition templates, and regenerated PNG exports.
- [`docs/design-overhaul.md`](../docs/design-overhaul.md) is historical design
  context only; do not treat it as the current source of truth when it conflicts
  with the active brand docs or this spec.

## Root Decisions (Locked)

These decisions are final. Do not second-guess them.

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Local STT | Parakeet TDT 0.6B via FluidAudio CoreML/ANE (`v3` multilingual default, `v2` English-only opt-in); Nemotron 3.5 Beta, WhisperKit, and Cohere Transcribe optional | Parakeet gives 155x realtime and low RAM for supported languages; v2 avoids language auto-detect for English-only use; Nemotron is a fast opt-in Beta path with multilingual (default) and English-only builds; Whisper adds mature broad multilingual coverage locally; Cohere is a larger batch-only accuracy path |
| Database | SQLite via GRDB | Single file, embedded, zero config |
| Platform | macOS 14.2+ (Apple Silicon only) | FluidAudio requires Apple Silicon; Swift 6 language mode (tools-version 5.9) |
| Business model | Current public build free/GPL/unlocked; official paid distribution/support remains possible | Originally $49 one-time (ADR-003), went free with open-source release in v0.5; retained purchase activation plumbing is future-option code |

## Release Channels And Feature Flags

> Canonical release-status block for agents and docs. Update this section when
> release channel framing changes or an `AppFeatures` flag flips.

| Channel | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Stable DMG | User-facing release, recommended for normal use | Dictation, file/media URL transcription, meeting recording, calendar auto-start (opt-in, default off), Transforms, VAD-guided meeting live-preview chunking, optional Nemotron Beta and WhisperKit, exports, vocabulary, AI features |
| `main` | Development | Latest stable release plus untagged fixes, Cohere Transcribe, and the flag delta below |

Current `main` feature gates in `Sources/MacParakeetCore/AppFeatures.swift`:

| Flag | Value | Release note |
|------|-------|--------------|
| `meetingRecordingEnabled` | `true` | Shipping meeting-recording surface |
| `calendarEnabled` | `true` | Shipping calendar reminders/auto-start; per-user auto-start defaults off |
| `meetingAutoStopEnabled` | `true` | `main` dogfood flag for ADR-023; per-user setting defaults off and is not yet in a tagged release |
| `meetingCaptureReliabilityEnabled` | `true` | Default-on kill switch for ADR-025 Phase A mic-health telemetry watchdog |
| `meetingActivityDetectionEnabled` | `false` | ADR-024 collectors/detector are compiled but runtime coordinator/UI remain gated |
| `transformsEnabled` | `true` | Productized Transforms shipping surface |
| `cohereEngineEnabled` | `true` | Settings exposes Cohere Transcribe as an opt-in, downloaded, batch-only local engine; no live preview/timestamps |
| `meetingVadLiveChunkingEnabled` | `true` | VAD-guided meeting live-preview chunking; final post-stop transcript path unchanged |
| `liveDictationStreamingEnabled` | `true` | Display-only live dictation preview enabled on `main`; final paste remains stop-time transcription |
| `aiFormatterProfilesEnabled` | `false` | App-aware AI Formatter profiles are code-complete but held out of the current tagged release train |

- [x] Customizable Ask quick prompts: GRDB-backed unified prompt library with pinning, Ask Prompts sheet, and `macparakeet-cli quick-prompts` import/export
- [x] Crash-resilient meeting recovery (ADR-019): session lock files, launch/settings recovery affordance, recovered badge
- [x] Dictation AI Formatter profiles: exact-app/category prompt routing, built-in smart defaults (readable + toggleable, master and per-category), Settings management, fallback prompt routing, local-only routing provenance surfaced in History
- [x] Fragmented MP4 meeting writer (ADR-019): 1s fragments, playable source audio after kill-9 up to the last fragment
- [x] Live meeting notepad (ADR-020): Notes/Transcript/Ask three-tab layout with Notes default (⌘1/⌘2/⌘3), debounced auto-save through `MeetingRecordingService.updateNotes`, lock-file extension carries notes through crash recovery, soft-cap warning at 7,500 words
- [x] Memo-steered summary infrastructure (ADR-020): `{{userNotes}}` + `{{transcript}}` template variables via `PromptTemplateRenderer` (single-pass, simultaneous), `userNotesSnapshot` captured on the `PromptResult` row at generation time. *Note: the "Memo-Steered Notes" built-in prompt that exercised this path was reverted on 2026-05-02 (see ADR-020 amendment) — the template variables remain available for custom prompts.*
- [x] Slash commands in Notes pane (ADR-020): `/action`, `/decision`, `/now` with in-view ZStack overlay (NSPanel-safe — never SwiftUI `.popover`), arrow-key + Return + Esc nav via `.onKeyPress`
- [x] Plain-noun tab strip with one ambient indicator (ADR-020 §1, amended 2026-05-02): `Notes`, `Transcript`, `Ask` plus a breathing dot on Ask while `chatViewModel.isStreaming`; `ViewThatFits` collapses the dot into the tooltip at the 360px floor
- [x] STT failure copy refinement (ADR-020): "Recording Error" → "Meeting interrupted" + Library-recovery hint wrapper around the technical detail

Calendar-related code is implemented and **enabled** (`AppFeatures.calendarEnabled = true`) after the post-#318 reliability hardening. It surfaces the Settings subsection, first-use permission prompt, search entry, reminder notifications, auto-start countdown, and coordinator polling; auto-start defaults to mode `.off`, so it is strictly opt-in:

- [x] Calendar-driven reminders (ADR-017 Phase 1): EventKit integration + first-use prompt + settings + per-calendar include list
- [x] Pre-meeting macOS notifications at configurable lead time (off / 1 / 5 / 10 min)
- [x] Auto-start countdown toast (ADR-017 Phase 2): 5s cancellable, top-right, non-activating
- [x] Activity-based auto-stop replacement (ADR-023 Phases A+B): scheduled end times remain removed; the default-off validation build stops only after app-quit or sustained dual-channel-silence signals persist through grace and a veto countdown is not dismissed.
- [x] Calendar event title applied to auto-started recordings instead of date-based default
- [x] Rich pre-meeting countdown toast for calendar starts (ADR-020): attendees + service icon row + steering hint pointing the user at the Notes tab. Manual-trigger toasts unchanged

### Optional Local STT Engines

- [x] WhisperKit dependency and `WhisperEngine` wrapper with local model cache at `~/Library/Application Support/MacParakeet/models/stt/whisper/`
- [x] Nemotron 3.5 Beta engine via FluidAudio CoreML, surfaced as opt-in local multilingual ASR with explicit model download/delete/status controls
- [x] Nemotron Speech Streaming EN 0.6B surfaced as a second opt-in English-only Beta build with persisted model selection (multilingual default) via the Settings Nemotron Model card, `config set nemotron-model`, `models select nemotron-english-1120ms`, and `transcribe --nemotron-model`; dictation streams live partials (live transcript preview) like the multilingual build, while file/meeting jobs run batch-at-stop
- [x] Cohere Transcribe via FluidAudio CoreML, surfaced on `main` as an opt-in downloaded local accuracy engine for batch dictation, file transcription, and meeting finalization; no live preview, word timestamps, or speaker labels
- [x] `SpeechEnginePreference`, `SpeechEngineSelection`, `ParakeetModelVariant`, and `NemotronModelVariant` persisted or modeled through `UserDefaults` where user-selectable
- [x] Settings → Speech Recognition segmented engine picker plus Parakeet Model, Nemotron Beta, Cohere Language, and Whisper Language cards/controls
- [x] Engine switching blocked while jobs are queued/running or a meeting speech-engine lease is active
- [x] CLI `transcribe --engine parakeet|nemotron|whisper|cohere --language <code> --parakeet-model app-default|v3|v2|unified`, `config set parakeet-model`, `config set nemotron-language`, `config set cohere-language`, and `models download parakeet-v2|parakeet-v3|parakeet-unified|nemotron-multilingual-1120ms|nemotron-english-1120ms|cohere-transcribe|whisper-large-v3-v20240930-turbo-632MB`
- [x] Meeting recordings capture the active engine/language at start and preserve it through metadata, lock files, crash recovery, and final transcription

### v0.6 Productized Transforms

- [x] `Prompt.Category.transform` rows for saved Transforms, with built-in `Polish`, `Distill`, and `Decide`
- [x] `keyboardShortcut` and `runningLabel` prompt columns for global hotkeys and floating progress copy
- [x] `TransformsHotkeyRegistry` single event tap, collision detection, and default `Control-Option-1`, `Control-Option-2`, and `Control-Option-3` built-in bindings
- [x] AX-first selection capture with clipboard fallback, in-place replacement, cancel/error clipboard restoration, and progress pill
- [x] Transforms sidebar tab and management UI enabled on `main` by `AppFeatures.transformsEnabled = true`
- [x] Local Transform history with input/output/source-app/timing stored in `transform_history`
- [x] CLI `transforms` and `transforms history` command trees for headless provisioning and verification
