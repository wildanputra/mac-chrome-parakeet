# 05 - Audio Pipeline

> Status: **ACTIVE** - Authoritative, current

The audio pipeline handles all audio input for MacParakeet: microphone recording for dictation, file input for transcription, and dual-stream capture (system audio + mic) for meeting recording.

---

## Microphone Recording (Dictation)

### Capture Chain

```
Mic Input → SharedMicrophoneStream tap → temp WAV → selected local STT engine
```

- **Shared mic engine**: `AudioRecorder` subscribes to the process-wide `SharedMicrophoneStream` with `wantsVPIO: false`
- The stream owns the underlying `AVAudioEngine` input-node tap and handles device fallback centrally
- **Output format**: temporary WAV, 16kHz mono Float32
- **Minimum sample threshold**: 16,000 samples required before sending to STT. Header-only and near-empty recordings are rejected before they reach the speech engine.
- Dictation always extracts channel 0 before conversion so VPIO duplex layouts produce the post-AEC mono stream instead of channel-mixed reference audio.
- Dictation does not use the meeting crash-recovery lock-file pipeline. The current implementation writes a temp WAV and either moves it into retained storage or deletes it after processing.

### Storage

```
~/Library/Application Support/MacParakeet/dictations/{uuid}.wav
```

- Each dictation gets a UUID-named WAV file
- Storage preferences (keep audio, auto-delete after N days) are user-configurable

### Recording Lifecycle

```
User triggers dictation
    → Check microphone permission
    → Subscribe to SharedMicrophoneStream
    → Shared stream starts the mic engine if needed
    → Convert samples to 16kHz mono Float32
    → Write to temp WAV
    → User stops dictation (or release-to-stop)
    → Validate sample count >= 16,000
    → Send to selected local STT engine through STTScheduler
    → Move WAV to dictations/ for storage (if enabled)
    → Clean up temp WAV (if storage disabled)
```

## File Input (Transcription)

### Conversion Pipeline

```
Input File → FFmpeg → 16kHz mono WAV → selected local STT engine → Transcript
```

- **FFmpeg** (bundled with the app) handles format conversion to 16kHz mono WAV
- The STT engine requires 16kHz mono Float32 input; FFmpeg normalizes all formats to this

### Supported Formats

| Category | Formats |
|----------|---------|
| Audio | MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, OGG, OPUS |
| Video | MP4, MOV, MKV, WebM, AVI |

### Constraints

- **Max file size**: 4 hours of audio (configurable)
- **Temp file management**: intermediate WAV files are automatically cleaned up after transcription completes (success or failure)
- FFmpeg runs as a subprocess; phase updates are reported to the UI (download/transcribe progress where available)
- The selected speech engine is Parakeet by default. WhisperKit can be selected globally in Settings or per CLI invocation for broader language coverage.

### Conversion Flow

```
User selects file
    → Validate format (check extension + probe with FFmpeg)
    → Validate duration <= max (4 hours default)
    → Convert to 16kHz mono WAV via FFmpeg
    → Send to selected local STT engine through STTScheduler
    → Return transcript
    → Clean up temp WAV
```

## YouTube URL Input (Transcription)

### Download + Conversion Pipeline

```
YouTube URL → yt-dlp (audio only) → downloaded audio file → FFmpeg → 16kHz mono WAV → selected local STT engine → Transcript
```

- `yt-dlp` is used with `--no-playlist` for single-video processing
- Download progress is parsed from yt-dlp output and surfaced as percent updates
- Downloaded files are written to:

```
~/Library/Application Support/MacParakeet/youtube-downloads/
```

### Retention Policy

- **Default:** keep downloaded YouTube audio (`saveTranscriptionAudio = true`)
- If disabled in Settings, downloaded YouTube audio is deleted after transcription
- Users can manually clear retained YouTube downloads from Settings > Storage

### URL Transcription Flow

```
User pastes YouTube URL
    → Validate URL format (single video)
    → Download audio via yt-dlp (emit "Downloading audio... X%")
    → Convert to 16kHz mono WAV via FFmpeg
    → Send to selected local STT engine (emit "Transcribing... X%")
    → Save transcription (sourceURL set, filePath set only if retention enabled)
    → Clean up temp WAV (always)
```

```

- **System audio** is captured via ScreenCaptureKit `SCStream` audio (`SCStreamConfiguration.capturesAudio = true`), which avoids owning or clocking a HAL aggregate output device.
- **Mic audio** is captured by subscribing to `SharedMicrophoneStream` with a typed policy (`MeetingMicProcessingMode`): `vpioPreferred` (default), `vpioRequired`, or `raw`.
- MacParakeet ships meeting capture with VPIO preferred for the mic path and ScreenCaptureKit for system audio. The older Core Audio process-tap path was removed from production because it does not reliably coexist with VPIO in-process. See `docs/research/vpio-process-tap-conflict.md`.
- Both streams are captured within the same meeting session and aligned by host time. `CaptureOrchestrator` owns join + offset + chunk boundaries via `MeetingAudioPairJoiner` + `AudioChunker`.
- Mic conditioning is pass-through. When VPIO engages, macOS has already applied AEC/noise suppression/AGC before buffers reach `MeetingRecordingService`; if VPIO falls back to raw, the service logs the degraded mode and keeps transcript-layer system-dominance suppression.
- Audio is stored as separate M4A files (AAC 64kbps, 48kHz mono) per source
- Source audio is written as fragmented M4A with 1-second movie fragments so kill-9 recovery can keep playable audio through the last committed fragment.
- After recording stops, microphone + system M4As are merged into `meeting.m4a`. Dual-input sessions preserve source separation as stereo (`L=mic`, `R=system`), while single-input sessions remain mono.
- Final meeting STT does **not** transcribe `meeting.m4a`. It transcribes `microphone.m4a` and `system.m4a` separately with the engine captured at recording start, then merges those fresh results by persisted `MeetingSourceAlignment`. `meeting.m4a` is kept as the playback/export artifact. See `docs/research/meeting-dual-stream-transcription-pipeline.md` for the full pipeline and tradeoffs.
- Live chunk enqueue keeps a conservative guard: when recent system energy strongly dominates processed mic energy for a short freshness window, mic chunks are skipped for live transcription only. Mic audio is still written to disk and included in final mix/output.
- Joiner queue overflow, long-session sync lag, and runtime capture failures are emitted as diagnostics for observability (`MeetingAudioCaptureEvent.error` where available).

### Key Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `SystemAudioStream` | ScreenCaptureKit system-audio wrapper - creates an audio-only `SCStream`, adapts `CMSampleBuffer` to `AVAudioPCMBuffer`, and emits stall diagnostics |
| `SharedMicrophoneStream` | Process-wide microphone engine owner, VPIO arbiter, and synchronous buffer fan-out |
| `MicrophoneCapture` | Meeting mic subscriber with explicit mic-processing policy, effective-mode reporting, and stall diagnostics |
| `MeetingAudioCaptureService` | Actor combining both streams into `AsyncStream<MeetingAudioCaptureEvent>` with `.bufferingNewest(2048)` and runtime error emission where available |
| `CaptureOrchestrator` | Owns ingest/join/offset/chunk flow for live preview |
| `MicConditioner` | Pass-through seam for mic samples after upstream VPIO processing |
| `LiveChunkTranscriber` | Owns live chunk queueing, cancellation, ordering, STT invocation |
| `MeetingAudioStorageWriter` | Writes separate M4A files per source (mic + system) |
| `MeetingRecordingMetadataStore` | Persists `MeetingSourceAlignment` for post-stop merge correctness |
| `MeetingRecordingLockFileStore` | Persists in-progress session state, notes, and captured speech engine for crash recovery |
| `MeetingTranscriptFinalizer` | Merges fresh per-source STT results into the final meeting transcript |

### Meeting Recording Flow

```text
User clicks "Start Meeting Recording"
    → Check Screen Recording permission (CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess)
    → If denied: show error + "Open System Settings" button, block recording
    → Acquire speech-engine lease from STTScheduler and capture current engine/language
    → Start MeetingAudioCaptureService (both streams)
    → Show recording pill (red dot + elapsed timer + stop button)
    → Consume AsyncStream<MeetingAudioCaptureEvent>, write buffers to M4A files
      and keep `recording.lock` current with session state/notes/speech engine
    → User clicks Stop
    → Stop capture, finalize `microphone.m4a` + `system.m4a`
    → Persist `meeting-recording-metadata.json` with source alignment and speech engine
    → Merge streams into `meeting.m4a` (stereo for dual input; mono for single input)
    → Convert `microphone.m4a` → 16kHz mono WAV via FFmpeg
    → Send mic WAV to captured local STT engine
    → Convert `system.m4a` → 16kHz mono WAV via FFmpeg
    → Send system WAV to captured local STT engine
    → Merge fresh per-source STT using persisted source offsets
    → Optionally refine the isolated system side with diarization
    → Save as Transcription with sourceType = .meeting
    → Navigate to transcription detail view
```

### Storage

```text
~/Library/Application Support/MacParakeet/meeting-recordings/{uuid}/
    ├── microphone.m4a    # Mic audio (AAC, 48kHz mono)
    ├── system.m4a        # System audio (AAC, 48kHz mono)
    ├── meeting.m4a       # Final playback/export artifact (stereo dual-source when both tracks exist; legacy fallback for downstream tools)
    ├── meeting-recording-metadata.json  # Persisted source timing/alignment + speech engine for post-stop merge
    ├── recording.lock     # In-progress recovery state, including notes and speech engine
    └── chunks/            # Live-preview scratch chunks
```

Audio files are kept by default. Users can delete manually from the transcription detail view.

### Concurrent Operation with Dictation (ADR-015)

Meeting recording and dictation share one process-wide microphone engine. Both flows subscribe to the same `SharedMicrophoneStream`, and the stream fans every captured buffer out to all subscribers:

| Flow | Shared mic role | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Dictation | `AudioRecorder` subscribes with `wantsVPIO: false` | Copies tap buffers for async conversion/writes and extracts ch[0] so VPIO duplex layouts produce post-AEC mono |
| Meeting mic | `MicrophoneCapture` subscribes with `wantsVPIO` derived from `MeetingMicProcessingMode` | VPIO preferred for hardware AEC, with raw fallback logged; meeting mic extracts ch[0] when VPIO is engaged |

`SharedMicrophoneStream` owns the single `AVAudioEngine`, fans buffers out synchronously, and keeps VPIO sticky once engaged. Engagement is deferred while a non-VPIO dictation subscriber is already in flight, so dictation does not get a mid-session format flip. If deferred VPIO promotion fails, the engine is marked dead, remaining subscriptions are invalidated after their `onEngineDeath` callbacks are captured, and later subscribers start a fresh engine. The shared-engine architecture is required (not a convenience) because VPIO is process-scoped — see ADR-015 §1 for the full rationale.

All STT work routes through a process-wide scheduler and shared runtime owner (ADR-016, ADR-021). Parakeet is the default engine; WhisperKit can be selected explicitly. That keeps:

- dictation on its own reserved interactive slot
- meeting live preview best-effort under backlog, with immediate post-stop finalization prioritized on the shared background slot
- file / YouTube transcription, plus legacy saved-meeting fallbacks without archived metadata, queued behind meeting work on that same background slot
- saved meetings with archived source metadata reuse the same `meetingFinalize` path as immediate post-stop finalization
- active meeting recordings pinned to one speech engine/language for live preview, finalization, and crash recovery

The primary concurrency use case remains meeting recording + dictation. File transcription may coexist architecturally, but it should never degrade dictation responsiveness.

### Live Preview

`AudioChunker` buffers audio into chunks with overlap and sends them through the scheduler using the meeting's captured speech engine during recording. This provides:
- Live transcript preview in the recording pill
- Source-aware labels: mic chunks → "Me", system chunks → "Them"
- VPIO-preferred mic capture plus a residual safeguard that suppresses clearly system-dominant mic chunks in live preview windows
- Immediate transcript availability when recording stops

## Permissions

| Permission | Why | When Requested | Fallback |
|------------|-----|----------------|----------|
| Microphone | Dictation recording | First dictation attempt | Show permission dialog with instructions |
| Accessibility | Global hotkey detection + text insertion | First dictation attempt | Show System Settings deep link |
| Screen & System Audio Recording | Meeting recording (system audio capture via ScreenCaptureKit) | First meeting recording attempt | Show error + "Open System Settings" button, block recording |

### Permission Flow

1. Check permission status before starting the relevant feature
2. If not granted, show an in-app dialog explaining why the permission is needed
3. Provide a button to open System Settings to the correct pane
4. Poll for permission grant (Accessibility) or use callback (Microphone)
5. Never block the entire app — only the feature that requires the permission
