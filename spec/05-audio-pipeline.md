# 05 - Audio Pipeline

> Status: **ACTIVE** - Authoritative, current

The audio pipeline handles all audio input for MacParakeet: microphone recording for dictation, file input for transcription, and dual-stream capture (system audio + mic) for meeting recording.

## Microphone Recording (Dictation)

### Capture Chain

```
Mic Input → SharedMicrophoneStream tap → temp WAV → selected local STT engine
```

- **Shared mic engine**: `AudioRecorder` subscribes to the process-wide `SharedMicrophoneStream` with `wantsVPIO: false`
- The stream owns the underlying `AVAudioEngine` input-node tap and handles device fallback centrally
- **Output format**: temporary WAV, 16kHz mono Float32
- **Minimum sample threshold**: 4,800 samples (0.3 seconds at 16kHz) required before sending to STT, mirroring FluidAudio's ASR guard. Header-only and near-empty recordings are rejected before they reach the speech engine.
- Dictation always extracts channel 0 before conversion so VPIO duplex layouts produce the post-AEC mono stream instead of channel-mixed reference audio.
- **Instant Dictation**: default-off setting that keeps a passive shared-stream subscriber attached while idle, stores a bounded 1-second RAM-only ring at 16kHz mono, and prepends up to 0.45 seconds to the next dictation WAV. macOS shows the microphone indicator while this is enabled. No STT or transcript processing runs while idle. The warm hold is suppressed while the resolved input device is Bluetooth (an idle open Bluetooth mic pins the headset in HFP/SCO and degrades playback — issue #481); dictation then cold-starts with no pre-roll. Warm-capture refreshes triggered by microphone-selection/default-input changes are debounced (0.5 s trailing) so notification bursts collapse into one engine restart.
- **Pre-roll discard on confirmed media pause (issue #474)**: when the Pause Media round-trip confirms system media was playing at press time, `stop()` trims the prepended pre-roll from the WAV before transcription — it is pre-press audio that no pause can silence, so on speakers it would put the media's speech at the head of the transcript. The minimum-sample threshold then applies to the post-trim count, so an effectively media-only capture dismisses silently. Best-effort: a pause confirmation that settles after capture stops keeps the pre-roll.
- Dictation does not use the meeting crash-recovery lock-file pipeline. The current implementation writes a temp WAV and either moves it into retained storage or deletes it after processing.

### Storage

```
~/Library/Application Support/MacParakeet/dictations/{uuid}.wav
```

- Each dictation gets a UUID-named WAV file
- Storage preferences (keep audio, auto-delete after N days) are user-configurable

### Recording Lifecycle

```
User triggers dictation
    → Check microphone permission
    → If Instant Dictation is enabled, stop accepting idle pre-roll
      and prepend the most recent in-memory samples to the temp WAV
    → Subscribe to SharedMicrophoneStream
    → Shared stream starts the mic engine if needed
    → Convert samples to 16kHz mono Float32
    → Write to temp WAV
    → User stops dictation (or release-to-stop)
    → Validate sample count >= 4,800
    → Send to selected local STT engine through STTScheduler
    → Move WAV to dictations/ for storage (if enabled)
    → Clean up temp WAV (if storage disabled)
```

## File Input (Transcription)

### Conversion Pipeline

```
Input File → FFmpeg → 16kHz mono WAV → selected local STT engine → Transcript
```

- **FFmpeg** (bundled with the app) handles format conversion to 16kHz mono WAV
- The STT engine requires 16kHz mono Float32 input; FFmpeg normalizes all formats to this

### Supported Formats

| Category | Formats |
|----------|---------|
| Audio | MP3, WAV, M4A, FLAC, OGG, OPUS |
| Video | MP4, MOV, MKV, WebM, AVI |

### Constraints

- **Max file size**: 4 hours of audio (configurable)
- **Temp file management**: intermediate WAV files are automatically cleaned up after transcription completes (success or failure)
- FFmpeg runs as a subprocess; phase updates are reported to the UI (download/transcribe progress where available)
- The selected speech engine is Parakeet by default. Within Parakeet, v3 is the multilingual default and v2 is an English-only opt-in; Nemotron Beta and WhisperKit can be selected globally in Settings or per CLI invocation for broader language coverage.

### Conversion Flow

```
User selects file
    → Extract embedded media metadata (title, author, artwork, duration) when present
    → Validate format (check extension + probe with FFmpeg)
    → Validate duration <= max (4 hours default)
    → Convert to 16kHz mono WAV via FFmpeg
    → Send to selected local STT engine through STTScheduler
    → Return transcript
    → Clean up temp WAV
```

## YouTube URL Input (Transcription)

### Download + Conversion Pipeline

```
YouTube URL → yt-dlp (audio only) → downloaded audio file → FFmpeg → 16kHz mono WAV → selected local STT engine → Transcript
```

- `yt-dlp` is used with `--no-playlist` for single-video processing
- YouTube audio quality is configurable:
  - **M4A** (default): `bestaudio[ext=m4a]/bestaudio/best`, preferring Apple-friendly saved audio files while falling back when m4a is unavailable
  - **Best available**: `bestaudio/best`, allowing higher-quality source streams such as Opus/WebM when YouTube offers them. Issue #237 measured ~10% lower Parakeet WER on Opus vs m4a for a Stanford speech. After STT completes, retained WebM/WebA/Opus/Ogg/MKV downloads are transcoded to `.m4a` (AAC 192k, faststart) in the background via bundled `ffmpeg` so AVPlayer can decode them for the in-app audio scrubber; conversion failures are non-fatal and the Show Video stream fallback remains available. Skipped entirely when retention is disabled.
- Download progress is parsed from yt-dlp output and surfaced as percent updates
- Downloaded files are written to:

```
~/Library/Application Support/MacParakeet/youtube-downloads/
```

### Retention Policy

- **Default:** keep downloaded YouTube audio (`saveTranscriptionAudio = true`)
- If disabled in Settings, downloaded YouTube audio is deleted after transcription
- Users can manually clear retained YouTube downloads from Settings > Storage

### URL Transcription Flow

```
User pastes YouTube URL
    → Validate URL format (single video)
    → Download audio via yt-dlp (emit "Downloading audio... X%")
    → Merge yt-dlp metadata with embedded audio metadata when needed
    → Convert to 16kHz mono WAV via FFmpeg
    → Send to selected local STT engine (emit "Transcribing... X%")
    → Save transcription (sourceURL set, filePath set only if retention enabled)
    → Clean up temp WAV (always)
    → If retention enabled AND saved file is WebM/WebA/Opus/Ogg/MKV,
        schedule a detached `ffmpeg` transcode to `.m4a` so the in-app
        audio scrubber can decode it. Update the row's `filePath` and
        delete the source on success. Non-fatal on failure.
```

```

- **Source mode** is user-configurable per recording start: microphone +
  system audio (default), microphone only, or system audio only. The selected
  mode controls both permission prompts and which capture streams are started.
- **System audio** is captured via ScreenCaptureKit `SCStream` audio
  (`SCStreamConfiguration.capturesAudio = true`) only when the source mode
  includes system audio, which avoids owning or clocking a HAL aggregate output
  device.
- **Mic audio** is captured by subscribing to `SharedMicrophoneStream` only
  when the source mode includes microphone audio, with a typed policy
  (`MeetingMicProcessingMode`): `raw` (default), `vpioPreferred`, or
  `vpioRequired`.
- MacParakeet ships meeting capture with raw mic capture and ScreenCaptureKit
  for system audio when both sources are selected. VPIO remains available for
  explicit experiments, but it is not the shipped default because live-call
  testing showed that engaging it can muffle the user's outgoing mic in
  Zoom/Meet. The older Core Audio process-tap path also remains out of
  production because it does not reliably coexist with VPIO in-process. See
  `docs/research/vpio-process-tap-conflict.md`.
- When both streams are selected, they are captured within the same meeting
  session and aligned by host time. `CaptureOrchestrator` owns join + offset +
  live-preview chunk boundaries via `MeetingAudioPairJoiner` plus per-source
  `MeetingLiveAudioChunking` strategies. Single-source sessions skip the
  unselected stream and produce a mono `meeting.m4a`.
- Mic conditioning is pass-through. Raw capture applies no capture-time AEC/noise suppression/AGC; transcript-layer system-dominance suppression remains the default guard against obvious speaker bleed. When VPIO is explicitly requested and engages, macOS applies AEC/noise suppression/AGC before buffers reach `MeetingRecordingService`.
- Audio is stored as separate M4A files (AAC 64kbps, 48kHz mono) per source
- Source audio is written as fragmented M4A with 1-second movie fragments so kill-9 recovery can keep playable audio through the last committed fragment.
- After recording stops, the captured source M4As are finalized and merged into
  `meeting.m4a`. Dual-input sessions preserve source separation as stereo
  (`L=mic`, `R=system`), while single-input sessions remain mono. The recovery
  lock is then rewritten to `awaitingTranscription`, and a processing Library
  row is saved before the recorder returns to idle.
- Final meeting STT does **not** transcribe `meeting.m4a`. A background queue
  transcribes the captured source files separately with the engine captured at
  recording start, then merges those fresh results by persisted
  `MeetingSourceAlignment`. `meeting.m4a` is kept as the playback/export
  artifact. See `docs/research/meeting-dual-stream-transcription-pipeline.md`
  for the full pipeline and tradeoffs.
- Recovery locks and retention safety are a tested boundary contract. See [`spec/contracts/meeting-recovery-retention.md`](contracts/meeting-recovery-retention.md) before changing lock-file predicates or automatic meeting-audio deletion.
- Live chunk enqueue keeps a conservative guard: when recent system energy strongly dominates processed mic energy for a short freshness window, mic chunks are skipped for live transcription only. Mic audio is still written to disk and included in final mix/output.
- Joiner queue overflow, long-session sync lag, and runtime capture failures are emitted as diagnostics for observability (`MeetingAudioCaptureEvent.error` where available).

### Key Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `SystemAudioStream` | ScreenCaptureKit system-audio wrapper - creates an audio-only `SCStream`, adapts `CMSampleBuffer` to `AVAudioPCMBuffer`, and emits stall diagnostics |
| `SharedMicrophoneStream` | Process-wide microphone engine owner, VPIO arbiter, and synchronous buffer fan-out |
| `MicrophoneCapture` | Meeting mic subscriber with explicit mic-processing policy, effective-mode reporting, and stall diagnostics |
| `MeetingAudioCaptureService` | Actor combining both streams into `AsyncStream<MeetingAudioCaptureEvent>` with `.bufferingNewest(2048)` and runtime error emission where available |
| `CaptureOrchestrator` | Owns ingest/join/offset/chunk flow for live preview |
| `MicConditioner` | Pass-through seam for mic samples; raw capture is the default, with VPIO only when explicitly requested |
| `LiveChunkTranscriber` | Owns live chunk queueing, cancellation, ordering, STT invocation |
| `MeetingAudioStorageWriter` | Writes separate M4A files per source (mic + system) |
| `MeetingRecordingMetadataStore` | Persists `MeetingSourceAlignment` for post-stop merge correctness |
| `MeetingRecordingLockFileStore` | Persists in-progress session state, notes, and captured speech engine for crash recovery |
| `MeetingTranscriptionQueue` | Owns FIFO background finalization for stopped meetings after audio + lock + Library stub are durable |
| `MeetingTranscriptFinalizer` | Merges fresh per-source STT results into the final meeting transcript |

### Meeting Recording Flow

```text
User clicks "Start Meeting Recording"
    → Resolve source mode
    → Check microphone permission only when the mode includes mic audio
    → Check Screen & System Audio Recording permission only when the mode includes system audio
    → If a required permission is denied: show error + "Open System Settings" button, block recording
    → Acquire speech-engine lease from STTScheduler and capture current engine/language
    → Start MeetingAudioCaptureService with the selected source mode
    → Show recording pill (red dot + elapsed timer + stop button)
    → Consume AsyncStream<MeetingAudioCaptureEvent>, write buffers to M4A files
      and keep `recording.lock` current with session state/notes/speech engine
    → User clicks Stop
    → Stop capture and finalize the captured source file(s)
    → Persist `meeting-recording-metadata.json` with source alignment and speech engine
    → Merge streams into `meeting.m4a` (stereo for dual input; mono for single input)
    → Atomically rewrite `recording.lock` to `awaitingTranscription`
    → Save a processing Transcription row with sourceType = .meeting and filePath = `meeting.m4a`
    → Enqueue background finalization and return recorder to idle
    → User may immediately start the next meeting recording
    → Background queue converts each captured source M4A → 16kHz mono WAV via FFmpeg
    → Send each source WAV to the captured local STT engine
    → Merge fresh per-source STT using persisted source offsets
    → Optionally refine the isolated system side with diarization
    → Update the existing Transcription row and delete `recording.lock`
    → Navigate to transcription detail view only if no newer meeting recording is active
```

The foreground stop path is intentionally sequential, not concurrent: Meeting
B can start only after Meeting A's source audio, mixed playback artifact,
`awaitingTranscription` lock, and processing Library row are durable. Meeting
A's final STT then continues in the queue-owned background path.

This is a recorder-availability guarantee, not an instant-transcript guarantee.
Queued meeting finalization still uses the shared `STTScheduler` background
slot. If file, folder, YouTube, podcast, or media URL STT is already running,
the stopped meeting waits for that job to finish; once the slot is free,
`meetingFinalize` outranks later queued `fileTranscription` work.

### Storage

```text
~/Library/Application Support/MacParakeet/meeting-recordings/{uuid}/
    ├── microphone.m4a    # Mic audio when captured (AAC, 48kHz mono)
    ├── system.m4a        # System audio when captured (AAC, 48kHz mono)
    ├── meeting.m4a       # Final playback/export artifact (stereo dual-source when both tracks exist; legacy fallback for downstream tools)
    ├── meeting-recording-metadata.json  # Persisted source timing/alignment + speech engine for post-stop merge
    ├── recording.lock     # Recording/awaiting-transcription recovery state, including notes and speech engine
    └── chunks/            # Live-preview scratch chunks
```

Audio files are kept forever by default. Settings > Storage exposes a meeting
audio retention policy: keep forever, delete after 7/14/30/90 days, or delete
immediately after transcription. Users can also reveal, save a copy, or delete
managed meeting audio from the meeting detail view, Library/Meetings row menus,
Settings > Storage, and CLI support commands. Audio deletion clears the
transcript's stored `filePath` and removes the `meeting-recordings/{uuid}`
folder, but keeps the transcript row.

Scheduled retention only detaches audio for completed meeting rows with stored
audio paths. It skips any session folder that still has `recording.lock`, live
or dead PID, because those files are active or recoverable recording input.
Crash-recovered meetings are protected while recovery runs; once the lock is
removed and the recovered row is completed, normal retention applies. The same
lock guard protects manual cleanup: both `TranscriptionAssetCleanup` and the
`clear-meeting-audio` CLI refuse to remove a session folder while a
`recording.lock` is present, including dead-owner `awaitingTranscription` locks
whose audio is still queued for background transcription (back-to-back meeting
recording).

### Concurrent Operation with Dictation (ADR-015)

Meeting recording and dictation share one process-wide microphone engine. Both flows subscribe to the same `SharedMicrophoneStream`, and the stream fans every captured buffer out to all subscribers:

| Flow | Shared mic role | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Dictation | `AudioRecorder` subscribes with `wantsVPIO: false` | Copies tap buffers for async conversion/writes and extracts ch[0] if a VPIO duplex layout is already active |
| Instant Dictation warm lease | `AudioRecorder` subscribes with `wantsVPIO: false, blocksVPIOPromotion: false` while the setting is enabled, dictation is idle, and the resolved input is not Bluetooth | Keeps the mic engine warm and maintains only a bounded in-memory pre-roll; because it is passive, explicit VPIO subscribers can still promote the engine immediately when no active raw capture is in flight. Suppressed (dropped, not deferred) on Bluetooth inputs so the idle hold never pins a headset in HFP/SCO (issue #481) |
| Meeting mic | `MicrophoneCapture` subscribes with `wantsVPIO` derived from `MeetingMicProcessingMode` | Raw capture by default; VPIO can still be explicitly requested, and meeting mic extracts ch[0] when VPIO is engaged |

`SharedMicrophoneStream` owns the single `AVAudioEngine`, fans buffers out synchronously, and keeps VPIO sticky once engaged. Engagement is deferred while an active non-VPIO capture subscriber is already in flight, so dictation or raw meeting capture does not get a mid-session format flip. Passive warm subscribers do not count as blockers. If deferred VPIO promotion fails, the engine is marked dead, remaining subscriptions are invalidated after their `onEngineDeath` callbacks are captured, and later subscribers start a fresh engine. The shared-engine architecture is required (not a convenience) because VPIO is process-scoped — see ADR-015 §1 for the full rationale.

All STT work routes through a process-wide scheduler and shared runtime owner (ADR-016, ADR-021). Parakeet is the default engine family (`v3` multilingual default, `v2` English-only opt-in); Nemotron Beta and WhisperKit can be selected explicitly. That keeps:

- dictation on its own reserved interactive slot
- meeting live preview best-effort under backlog, with immediate post-stop finalization prioritized on the shared background slot
- file / YouTube transcription, plus legacy saved-meeting fallbacks without archived metadata, queued behind meeting work on that same background slot
- saved meetings with archived source metadata reuse the same `meetingFinalize` path as immediate post-stop finalization
- active meeting recordings pinned to one speech engine/language for live preview, finalization, and crash recovery

The primary concurrency use case remains meeting recording + dictation. File transcription may coexist architecturally, but it should never degrade dictation responsiveness.

### Dictation Live Preview

Dictation can show a display-only live transcript preview above the dictation
pill while you speak (`AppFeatures.liveDictationStreamingEnabled`, #517). It is
decoupled from the paste: the final inserted text always comes from the
stop-time transcription path, so a jumpy or approximate preview can never
corrupt the result. Per engine: Parakeet runs a single-flight tail-window batch
preview (~1s cadence over the last ~15s of mic samples through its existing
`[Float]` batch path); both Nemotron builds reuse their native live-partial
path; Whisper stays default-off pending a per-pass latency probe. Users toggle
it — and pick a preview text size — in Settings → Capture → Dictation
(`showLiveDictationPreview`, default on); the toggle gates only the preview
sink.

Before display the raw preview stream passes through a `LiveTranscriptStabilizer`
(owned by `DictationService`, reset per session): it aligns each update against
the committed tail and only ever appends — committing the stable body and holding
the last few words as a volatile hypothesis — so already-shown words don't jump,
re-spell, or disappear as the window slides or partials are revised. The overlay
renders this as a bottom-anchored rolling readout: the newest line is pinned to
the bottom and older lines rise and fade out at the top edge via a gradient mask,
with no mid-word head truncation. Stabilization is display-only and can never
alter the pasted text. See `docs/research/live-dictation-streaming.md`.

### Meeting Live Preview

`CaptureOrchestrator` buffers audio into live-preview chunks and sends them through the scheduler using the meeting's captured speech engine during recording. The fixed fallback keeps the original 5s / 1s-overlap `AudioChunker` cadence. When `AppFeatures.meetingVadLiveChunkingEnabled` is true, launch-time prep tries to cache the Silero VAD model; if it is cached and the meeting uses Parakeet, the live path cuts chunks at speech boundaries per source. Nemotron and Whisper sessions currently use the fixed cadence. VAD unavailable/error cases fall back to the fixed cadence, and the final post-stop transcript is unchanged. This provides:
- Live transcript preview in the recording pill
- Source-aware labels: mic chunks → "Me", system chunks → "Them"
- Raw mic capture plus a residual safeguard that suppresses clearly system-dominant mic chunks in live preview windows
- Immediate transcript availability when recording stops

## Permissions

| Permission | Why | When Requested | Fallback |
|------------|-----|----------------|----------|
| Microphone | Dictation recording and meeting modes that include mic audio | Onboarding, first dictation attempt, or first mic-capturing meeting attempt | Show permission dialog with instructions |
| Accessibility | Global shortcut detection + text insertion | Onboarding or first dictation attempt | Show System Settings deep link |
| Screen & System Audio Recording | Meeting modes that include system audio capture via ScreenCaptureKit | Optional onboarding step or first system-audio meeting attempt | Show error + "Open System Settings" button, block recording |

### Permission Flow

1. Check permission status before starting the relevant feature
2. If not granted, show an in-app dialog explaining why the permission is needed
3. Provide a button to open System Settings to the correct pane
4. Poll for permission grant (Accessibility) or use callback (Microphone)
5. Never block the entire app — only the feature that requires the permission
