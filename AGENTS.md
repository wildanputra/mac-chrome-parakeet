## What this project is

MacParakeet is a fast, private, local-first voice app for macOS. The v0.6
release has three co-equal capture modes: system-wide dictation, file
transcription, and meeting recording, plus productized Transforms
for selected-text rewrites. Parakeet TDT 0.6B via FluidAudio CoreML on the
Apple Neural Engine is the default STT family: multilingual v3 is the default,
and English-only v2 is an opt-in Parakeet model for users who want the fastest
English path without v3 auto-detect. Two optional local engines extend
coverage: Nemotron 3.5 (Beta), a fast multilingual FluidAudio streaming
engine, and WhisperKit for languages Parakeet does not cover.

**Release status:** The notarized Stable DMG is the user-facing release
channel; `main` is development. The canonical channel framing — including
which `AppFeatures` flags differ between `main` and the latest release tag —
lives in one place: [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) → "Release Channels". Check
there before describing release status anywhere; don't restate it in other
docs.

Free and open-source (GPL-3.0). Apple Silicon only. Requires macOS 14.2+.

The repo ships two products:

- **`macparakeet-cli`** -- versioned public surface
  ([`Sources/CLI/`](./Sources/CLI/), semver tracked in
  [`Sources/CLI/CHANGELOG.md`](./Sources/CLI/CHANGELOG.md)).
- **`MacParakeet.app`** -- SwiftUI macOS app, one consumer of the CLI's
  underlying core library.

## Build & Test

```bash
# Build everything (app + CLI + core + viewmodels + tests)
swift build

# Run the test suite (Swift 6 language mode)
swift test

# Focused run of one test class while iterating (full suite before merge)
swift test --filter TextProcessingPipelineTests

# Build, codesign, and launch the dev app
scripts/dev/run_app.sh

# Run the CLI against your local DB
swift run macparakeet-cli --help
swift run macparakeet-cli health
```

**Inner loop:** `scripts/dev/check.sh [TestFilter]` runs a debug build +
optional filtered tests + report-only `swift-format` lint. Use it for fast
iteration; `scripts/dev/ci_local.sh` remains the full pre-merge check. Run
`scripts/dev/format.sh` to auto-format before committing.

The full test suite is deterministic and normally finishes in roughly one to
two minutes depending on SwiftPM cache state. Run `swift test` before declaring
code-change work complete.

## Git & Worktrees

This repo runs many parallel worktrees. Two rules that save real time:

- **Base new branches/worktrees on `origin/main`, not local `main`** — the
  local `main` ref is often stale here. `git fetch origin` first, then
  `git worktree add -b my-branch ../macparakeet-worktrees/my-branch origin/main`.
- **Build from the worktree the branch is checked out in.** Xcode/SwiftPM
  state under `.swiftpm/` pins source paths to the worktree that created it,
  so `xcodebuild` invoked from another checkout can silently compile the
  wrong tree. `swift build` / `swift test` from inside the worktree are
  always safe.

More git/CI gotchas (flaky-test policy, line-ending rules): [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) → "Known Pitfalls".

## Code Style

- Swift package tools-version 5.9; first-party Swift is kept Swift 6
  language-mode / concurrency clean. SwiftUI for UI and GRDB for SQLite.
- One repository per database table (see
  [`Sources/MacParakeetCore/Database/`](./Sources/MacParakeetCore/Database/)).
- Comments explain *why*, not *what* -- well-named identifiers carry the what.
  Default to writing none.
- `MacParakeetCore` has no SwiftUI/view dependencies. It is primarily
  Foundation + GRDB + FluidAudio + optional WhisperKit, with small
  AppKit-backed macOS adapter services where no Foundation-only API exists
  (`ClipboardService`, `PermissionService`, `TelemetryService` termination
  notification, `ExportService`). New AppKit use in Core should stay
  adapter-shaped and must not introduce UI ownership.
- ViewModels live in their own SPM target (`Sources/MacParakeetViewModels/`)
  so they can be tested without the GUI.
- Async/await for all I/O. No completion handlers, no Combine in new code.
- Buttons use `.parakeetAction(.primary / .primaryProminent / .secondary / .destructive / .destructiveProminent / .subtle)` for semantic role + styling. Never apply `.tint(coral)` at NSHostingView roots or sheet wrappers — coral cascades only from `parakeetAction`. See `spec/04-ui-patterns.md` → Buttons.

## Architecture Orientation

```
Sources/
  MacParakeetCore/        -- Pure Swift library: STT, DB, prompts, LLM, audio
  MacParakeetViewModels/  -- @Observable view models, no UI
  MacParakeet/            -- SwiftUI app target
  CLI/                    -- macparakeet-cli; ArgumentParser commands
Tests/
  MacParakeetTests/       -- Unit, database, integration tests
  CLITests/               -- CLI argument-parsing + helper tests
```

Full spec is in [`spec/`](./spec/). Architectural decisions (locked) are in
[`spec/adr/`](./spec/adr/). Don't second-guess ADRs.

**Subsystem READMEs.** Load-bearing folders inside
[`Sources/MacParakeetCore/`](./Sources/MacParakeetCore/) carry their own
`README.md` capturing non-obvious rules (threading, ordering,
retention) that aren't visible from grep. **When you're about to edit
inside one of these folders, read its README first.** Folders with
READMEs today: `Audio/`, `STT/`, `TextProcessing/`, `Database/`,
`Licensing/`.

## Security & Privacy

- **Local-first speech.** STT runs on the Apple Neural Engine. Audio and
  transcripts stay on-device for core dictation, transcription, and meeting
  recording. Network surfaces are limited to user-triggered LLM providers,
  media downloads, model/update flows, retained purchase activation endpoints
  if explicitly invoked, and opt-out self-hosted telemetry/crash reporting.
  Telemetry never includes audio or transcript content.
- **Retained purchase activation is intentional.** The old
  LemonSqueezy/trial entitlement code is dormant in current free/GPL builds,
  but it is deliberate future-option plumbing. Do not delete or "clean up"
  `EntitlementsService`, `LemonSqueezyLicenseAPI`, entitlement state, or
  trial/license telemetry as dead code unless explicitly requested by the
  project owner and reflected in an ADR/spec update.
- **No accounts, no logins.** No identifying data is sent anywhere.
- **The user database lives at**
  `~/Library/Application Support/MacParakeet/macparakeet.db`. Treat it as user
  data: never delete without explicit user confirmation; write migrations
  rather than dropping tables.

## Where to Look Next

- **Coding-agent context for this repo:** [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) for deep
  project context; [`spec/10-ai-coding-method.md`](./spec/10-ai-coding-method.md)
  for spec precedence and lightweight kernel usage; ADRs in
  [`spec/adr/`](./spec/adr/) for locked decisions.
- **Calling macparakeet-cli from another agent (OpenClaw / Hermes / etc.):**
  [`integrations/README.md`](./integrations/README.md) and the CLI changelog
  at [`Sources/CLI/CHANGELOG.md`](./Sources/CLI/CHANGELOG.md).
- **Commit format:** rich-format messages per
  [`docs/commit-guidelines.md`](./docs/commit-guidelines.md) for significant
  changes.
- **PR & review workflow:** branch-first PR loop, reviewing to LGTM with
  judgment, agent fresh-eye review, convergence, and the merge-ready checklist
  in [`docs/pr-review-workflow.md`](./docs/pr-review-workflow.md). Scale the
  ceremony to the change — trivial fixes go straight to `main`.
