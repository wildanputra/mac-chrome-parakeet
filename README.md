MacParakeet runs NVIDIA's Parakeet TDT on Apple's Neural Engine via [FluidAudio](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio) CoreML. The v0.6 release scope includes system-wide dictation, file/URL transcription, meeting recording, and optional local WhisperKit recognition for languages Parakeet does not cover. All speech recognition happens on your Mac.

## Release status

The [notarized DMG](https://downloads.macparakeet.com/MacParakeet.dmg) is the stable release channel.

| Channel | Status | Includes |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Stable DMG | Recommended for normal use | Dictation, file/video/YouTube transcription, meeting recording, optional WhisperKit, exports, vocabulary, AI features |
| `main` branch | Development | v0.6 release scope plus hidden calendar auto-start code under `AppFeatures.calendarEnabled = false` |

Calendar reminders, auto-start, and auto-stop are implemented in source but hidden from the v0.6 product surface while they await end-to-end validation.

## What it does

**Dictation** — Press a hotkey in any app, speak, text gets pasted. Hold for push-to-talk, double-tap for persistent recording. Works system-wide.

**File transcription** — Drag audio or video files, or paste a YouTube URL. Full transcript with word-level timestamps, speaker labels, and export to 7 formats (TXT, Markdown, SRT, VTT, DOCX, PDF, JSON). Assign global hotkeys to trigger File or YouTube transcription from anywhere.

**Meeting recording** — Record system audio and microphone together, see a live local transcript preview, take notes during the call, then save the finalized transcript to the library with export, prompts, and chat.

**Text cleanup** — Filler word removal, custom word replacements, text snippets with triggers. Deterministic pipeline, no LLM needed.

**AI features** — Optional summaries, chat, and an AI formatter. Connect any cloud provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenRouter), local runtime (Ollama, LM Studio), OpenAI-compatible endpoint, or CLI tool (Claude Code, Codex). Entirely opt-in.

### Performance

- ~155x realtime — 60 min of audio in ~23 seconds
- ~2.5% word error rate (Parakeet TDT 0.6B-v3)
- ~66 MB working memory per active Parakeet inference slot
- 25 European languages with Parakeet auto-detection
- Optional local WhisperKit engine for Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and many other languages

### Limitations

- Apple Silicon only (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- Parakeet is best for English and supported European languages
- WhisperKit multilingual support requires a separate local model download before first use

## Get it

**Download:** Grab the [notarized DMG](https://downloads.macparakeet.com/MacParakeet.dmg) or visit [macparakeet.com](https://macparakeet.com). Drag to Applications, done.

First launch downloads the speech model (~6 GB) plus speaker-detection assets (~130 MB). Everything works fully offline after that.

The DMG is the stable release.

**Build from source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moona3k/macparakeet.git
cd macparakeet
swift test
scripts/dev/run_app.sh    # build, sign, launch
```

The dev script creates a signed `.app` bundle so macOS grants mic and accessibility permissions. It disables target-level Xcode signing, then signs the finished bundle with the best available local identity. Override with `MACPARAKEET_CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Your Identity"` if needed.

**CLI:**

```bash
swift run macparakeet-cli transcribe /path/to/audio.mp3
swift run macparakeet-cli models download whisper-large-v3-v20240930-turbo-632MB
swift run macparakeet-cli transcribe /path/to/korean.mp3 --engine whisper --language ko --format json
swift run macparakeet-cli models status
swift run macparakeet-cli history
```

The Whisper CLI commands above require a downloaded local WhisperKit model.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| STT | Parakeet TDT 0.6B-v3 via [FluidAudio](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio) CoreML (default) + optional local WhisperKit engine |
| STT orchestration | Shared runtime + explicit scheduler with a reserved dictation slot and a shared meeting/file slot; speech-engine routing and meeting-session pinning |
| Language | Swift 6.0 + SwiftUI |
| Database | SQLite via GRDB |
| Auto-updates | Sparkle 2 |
| YouTube | yt-dlp |
| Platform | macOS 14.2+, Apple Silicon |

## Vocabulary

The Vocabulary panel controls how dictated text is cleaned up before pasting. No AI involved — it's a fast, deterministic pipeline that runs in under 1ms.

You choose between two **processing modes**:

- **Raw** — Paste exactly what the speech engine produces, no changes
- **Clean** (default) — Run the text through a multi-step pipeline before pasting

**The Clean pipeline** applies these steps in order:

1. **Filler removal** — Strips "um", "uh", and sentence-start fillers like "so", "well", "like"
2. **Custom words** — Applies your word replacement rules (e.g., "aye pee eye" becomes "API", or "kubernetes" gets capitalized to "Kubernetes"). Case-insensitive, whole-word matching. Words can be toggled on/off without deleting.
3. **Voice Return** — If you've defined a trigger phrase (e.g., "press return") and speak it at the end of a dictation, it's stripped from the output and a Return keypress is simulated after paste
4. **Snippet expansion** — Replaces short trigger phrases with longer text (e.g., "my signature" expands to "Best regards, David"). Triggers are natural language phrases because that's what the speech engine outputs. Matched longest-first to prevent collisions.
5. **Whitespace cleanup** — Collapses spaces, fixes punctuation spacing, capitalizes the first letter

Every dictation stores both the raw and clean transcript so you can always see what changed.

## AI Features

AI features are entirely **opt-in** and separate from speech recognition — transcription is always local. The LLM only sees transcript text, never audio.

**What it does:**

- **Summarize** — After a transcription finishes, click Summarize and pick a prompt ("Summary", "Action Items & Decisions", "Chapter Breakdown", etc.) or write your own. The LLM processes the transcript and streams back a summary. You can generate multiple summaries per transcript, each in its own tab. Prompts marked as auto-run generate summaries automatically for new transcriptions.
- **Chat** — Ask questions about a transcript in a multi-turn chat interface. The LLM answers based on the transcript content.
- **AI formatter** — Optionally run your dictation and file transcripts through your AI provider to clean up grammar, punctuation, and paragraphing. Toggle on/off, customize the prompt, or reset to default.

**Supported providers:**

| Type | Options |
|------|---------|
| Cloud | Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI, Google Gemini, OpenRouter |
| Local | Ollama, LM Studio |
| Custom | OpenAI-Compatible (any API-shaped endpoint — vLLM, LocalAI, LiteLLM, llama.cpp server, third-party hosts) |
| CLI subprocess | Claude Code, Codex, or another configured command |

**Setup:** In Settings → AI Provider, pick a provider, enter an API key (cloud) or confirm the local server/CLI command is available, select a model, and hit Test Connection. Cloud providers store keys in the macOS Keychain. Ollama and LM Studio can keep LLM inference on-device. CLI subprocess providers run the configured command locally, but that command may contact its own cloud service.

## Privacy

All speech recognition runs locally. Parakeet uses the Neural Engine; the optional WhisperKit engine also runs on-device. Your audio never leaves your Mac.

- **No cloud STT.** The model runs on-device. No audio is transmitted.
- **No accounts.** No login, no email, no registration.
- **Opt-out telemetry.** Non-identifying usage analytics and crash reporting go to a self-hosted endpoint only when telemetry is enabled. No persistent IDs, no IP storage, and no transcript/audio content is transmitted. [Source code is right here](Sources/MacParakeetCore/Services/TelemetryService.swift) — verify it yourself.
- **Temp files cleaned up.** Audio deleted after transcription unless you save it.

**What does use the network:** AI summaries and chat connect to configured LLM providers, or to whatever service a configured CLI tool chooses to use, when you choose them. Sparkle checks for app updates. YouTube transcription downloads video via yt-dlp. Telemetry and crash reports go to our self-hosted server unless you opt out. Core dictation and transcription stay fully offline.

**Note:** Builds from source also send telemetry by default. Opt out in Settings or set `MACPARAKEET_TELEMETRY_URL` to override.
