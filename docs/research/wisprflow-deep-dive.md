# WisprFlow Deep Dive

> Status: **HISTORICAL** — Superseded by `wisprflow-reverse-engineering-2026-05.md` (May 2026, reverse-engineered from app binary v1.5.308). This doc was based on web research only. The local Qwen3-8B / Command Mode comparisons here are outdated because the on-device LLM path was removed 2026-02-23.

## What WisprFlow Does

WisprFlow is a system-wide voice-to-text tool for macOS, Windows, and iOS. It uses **cloud-based** speech-to-text (proprietary, likely Whisper-based) and cloud LLMs (GPT-4 class) for AI refinement. Positioned as a productivity multiplier for knowledge workers, particularly developers.

### Core Features

**Push-to-Talk Dictation**
- Hold Fn to record, release to transcribe and paste
- Double-tap Fn for persistent recording mode (tap again to stop)
- Hands-free mode via Fn+Space
- Text appears in the frontmost application automatically
- Works in any app with a text field (Notion, Gmail, Google Docs, Slack, Cursor, etc.)

**AI Auto-Editing**
- Removes filler words ("um", "uh", pauses) automatically
- Fixes grammar and punctuation from tone and pauses
- Adjusts formatting contextually (numbered lists spoken naturally)
- Preserves code syntax (exact spacing, camelCase, snake_case, acronyms)
- Course correction: "Let's meet at 2... actually 3" becomes "Let's meet at 3"

**Context Awareness**
- Uses macOS accessibility APIs to read text from the active app window
- Always knows the app name you're dictating in (adapts formatting)
- Reads surrounding textbox content for capitalization/punctuation hints
- Toggle on/off in Settings -> Data and Privacy
- Controversial: effectively captures screenshots and surrounding text data, sends to cloud
- WisprFlow claims 67% reduction in editing time with context awareness

**Styles (Pro, English/Desktop only)**
- Tone adaptation by context: formal, casual, enthusiastic
- Adapts to the type of document: email vs code comment vs Slack message
- User-configurable style presets

**Command Mode (Pro)**
- Select/highlight text in any app
- Say a natural language command, LLM edits text in-place
- The rewritten text replaces the highlighted selection
- Example commands:
  - "Make this more formal"
  - "Translate to Spanish"
  - "Turn this into bullet points"
  - "Summarize in two sentences"
  - "Bold the title"
  - "Delete the previous paragraph"
  - "Fix the code indentation"
- WisprFlow claims 90% of document editing can be done by voice alone
- Users report 60% time savings on editing tasks

**Personal Dictionary**
- Auto-learns vocabulary from corrections over time
- Manual entry for industry terms, product names, proper nouns
- Developer jargon recognition (Supabase, Cloudflare, Vercel)
- Team dictionary sharing on Teams/Enterprise plans
- Toggle auto-add in settings

**Voice Shortcuts (Snippets)**
- Custom trigger phrases that expand into pre-saved text
- Example: say "insert signature" -> pastes multi-line email signature
- Scheduling links, intros, FAQs
- Shared snippets on Teams plan

**Whisper Mode**
- Works with whispered speech
- Useful in shared office spaces, libraries, open floor plans
- Requires close mic proximity (~1cm)

**Developer Features**
- File tagging in Cursor/Windsurf with automatic context recognition
- Preserves exact spacing and formatting in code
- CamelCase, snake_case, and acronym handling
- CLI command support
- Vibe coding integrations (Cursor, Warp, VS Code)

**Language Support**
- 104+ languages with seamless switching mid-session

**Privacy Controls**
- Privacy Mode: zero data retention (audio/transcripts not stored or used for training)
- HIPAA-ready on all tiers (including free)
- SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 on Enterprise
- Context Awareness can be toggled off

## User Sentiment

### Trustpilot: 2.8/5 (28 reviews)

- 5-star: 39%
- 4-star: 7%
- 3-star: 4%
- 2-star: 11%
- 1-star: 39%

Highly polarized -- users either love it or hate it. The 1-star reviews cluster around reliability and support issues, not the core concept.

### What Users Love

**Speed**
- 175-179 WPM dictation vs 90 WPM average typing speed
- "4x faster than typing" is the marketing claim (2x in practice)
- Particularly valued by developers for code comments and documentation

**Universal Compatibility**
- Works in any app, any text field
- No app-specific plugins needed
- "Just works" in Slack, email, code editors, browsers

**AI Refinement**
- "It cleans up my rambling into coherent sentences"
- Context-aware tone adjustment is a standout feature
- Command Mode praised as "magic" by power users
- Course correction prevents awkward mid-sentence edits

### What Users Hate

**Non-Responsive Customer Support**
- Multiple 1-star reviews cite zero response to support tickets
- Some users report waiting weeks with no reply
- Billing issues (double charges) unresolved for months

**Buggy and Unreliable (~60% reliability)**
- "Works great when it works, but fails randomly"
- Users report ~60% reliability -- 4 out of 10 dictations have issues
- Common bugs: text appears in wrong window, partial transcriptions, app freezes

**Server Delays (20-30s during peak)**
- Cloud dependency means performance varies with server load
- Users report 20-30 second waits during peak hours
- "Unusable during US business hours"
- Latency spikes make it impractical for real-time workflows

**Privacy Concerns**
- Context awareness captures screen content and sends to cloud
- Some users uncomfortable with accessibility API data being transmitted
- Privacy Mode mitigates but doesn't eliminate (still processes in cloud)

**6-Minute Session Cap**
- Recording sessions limited to 6 minutes
- Must start a new session for longer dictation
- Breaks flow for long-form content

## Key Weaknesses -- MacParakeet Opportunities

### 1. Cloud Dependency = Privacy Risk + Latency

WisprFlow sends all audio to cloud servers for transcription. Context awareness sends screen content too. This creates:

- **Privacy risk**: Every word spoken + screen content transmitted to third party. Unacceptable for legal, medical, financial, classified, or any sensitive context.
- **Latency**: Server round-trip adds 2-5 seconds minimum, 20-30 seconds during peak. Local Parakeet on Apple Silicon is faster than the network round-trip.

**MacParakeet advantage:** 100% local. Parakeet runs on-device. Qwen3-8B runs on-device. Zero network latency. Zero privacy risk.

### 2. $144-180/Year Subscription

WisprFlow Pro costs $12-15/month, every month, forever. For a tool that could run locally on the user's own hardware, this is hard to justify.

**MacParakeet advantage:** current public build is free/GPL and runs locally. Future monetization should sell official convenience, support, hosted services, or team workflows rather than a required cloud STT subscription.

### 3. Poor Reliability (~60%)

4 out of 10 dictations having issues is unacceptable for a productivity tool. Users cannot trust it for important work.

**MacParakeet advantage:** Local processing eliminates server-side failure modes. No network timeouts, no server overload, no cloud outages.

### 4. No Local Option

Some users want voice-to-text but cannot or will not send audio to the cloud. WisprFlow offers no local alternative.

**MacParakeet advantage:** Local-only by design. This is not a fallback -- it is the architecture.

### 5. Context Awareness Privacy Problem

WisprFlow's context awareness reads screen content via accessibility APIs and sends it to cloud servers. Users who need context-aware dictation but can't share screen data have no option.

**MacParakeet advantage:** Context awareness via local Qwen3-8B -- read screen context locally, process locally, never transmit. Same feature, zero privacy risk. (Future)

| iOS app | Yes | Not planned (macOS only) | -- |
| Windows app | Yes | Not planned (macOS only) | -- |
| Offline operation | No | Always (by design) | Yes |
| Privacy (no cloud) | No | Always (by design) | Yes |

## MacParakeet's Positioning

**WisprFlow, but local.**

Take every feature that makes WisprFlow compelling -- push-to-talk, AI refinement, Command Mode, personal dictionary, context awareness -- and run it entirely on-device using Parakeet (155x realtime STT via FluidAudio CoreML on ANE) and Qwen3-8B (local LLM on GPU via MLX-Swift).

Then go further:
- **File transcription** (WisprFlow is dictation-only, no file import)
- **$49 one-time** vs $144-180/year
- **100% local** = no server delays, no privacy risk, no 6-minute session cap
- **Reliable** = no cloud outages, no "works 60% of the time"
- **Context awareness without cloud** = same feature, zero privacy risk

Command Mode via local Qwen3-8B is the key Pro feature. WisprFlow proves the demand. MacParakeet delivers it without the cloud.

## Technical Notes for MacParakeet Implementation

### What We Can Replicate Locally

| WisprFlow Feature | MacParakeet Local Implementation |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Cloud STT | Parakeet via FluidAudio CoreML/ANE (v3 default, v2 and Unified English opt-ins; ~155x faster) |
| Cloud LLM refinement | Qwen3-8B via MLX-Swift (on-device, ~2s cold start) |
| Context awareness | macOS Accessibility API (AXUIElement) + local Qwen3-8B |
| Auto-edit (filler/grammar) | Deterministic pipeline + Qwen3-8B |
| Command Mode | Selected text + voice command -> Qwen3-8B -> replace |
| Personal dictionary | SQLite custom_words table + pipeline lookup |
| Voice shortcuts | SQLite text_snippets table + trigger detection |

### What We Do Differently

1. **Deterministic pipeline first, LLM second**: Filler removal, custom words, and snippets are rule-based (ADR-004). LLM refinement is optional and additive. This gives predictable, fast results for 90% of cases.
2. **No cloud fallback**: We don't offer a cloud option. This is a feature, not a limitation. It simplifies the architecture and makes the privacy claim absolute.
3. **File transcription**: WisprFlow only does live dictation. We also transcribe audio/video files, which is a different (larger) market.
4. **No session limits**: Local processing means no 6-minute caps, no word limits, no throttling.
