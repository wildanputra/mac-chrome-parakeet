# Distribution (Developer ID + Notarization)

> Status: **ACTIVE** - Build, sign, notarize, and auto-update workflow

This repo is SwiftPM-based, so we assemble a `.app` bundle manually for Developer ID distribution.

## 1) Build the app bundle

From the repo root:

```bash
scripts/dist/build_app_bundle.sh
```

This creates `dist/MacParakeet.app` and bundles:
- `Assets/AppIcon.icns` into `Contents/Resources/AppIcon.icns` (app icon for Dock, Finder, DMG)
- `macparakeet-cli` into `Contents/MacOS/macparakeet-cli`
- SwiftPM resource bundles into `Contents/Resources/`
- Standalone helper binaries (FFmpeg, yt-dlp helper seed, and optional Node runtime) into `Contents/Resources/` when configured by the build scripts
- No Python runtime or `uv` bootstrap is bundled (FluidAudio/CoreML STT is native Swift)

`build_app_bundle.sh` automatically downloads a **statically-linked FFmpeg** from [ffmpeg.martin-riedl.de](https://ffmpeg.martin-riedl.de/) (macOS arm64, SHA256-verified). No Homebrew dependency. To use a custom binary instead, set `FFMPEG_PATH`:

```bash
FFMPEG_PATH=/absolute/path/to/static-ffmpeg scripts/dist/build_app_bundle.sh
```

The script verifies the bundled binary has no non-system dylib dependencies (portability check via `otool -L`).

`yt-dlp` is bundled as a signed helper seed. At runtime, the app/CLI copies it
to `~/Library/Application Support/MacParakeet/bin/yt-dlp` before first YouTube
transcription so future helper updates never mutate the signed app bundle. To
use a pre-fetched helper in release builds, set `YTDLP_PATH`; set
`BUNDLE_YTDLP=0` only for diagnostic builds.

Meeting echo suppression assets are optional for local/dev bundles, but any
build that claims speaker-mode AEC readiness must bundle and verify both native
assets:

```bash
export MACPARAKEET_MEETING_ECHO_LIBRARY=/absolute/path/to/liblocalvqe.dylib
export MACPARAKEET_MEETING_ECHO_MODEL=/absolute/path/to/localvqe-v1.4-aec-200K-f32.gguf
export MACPARAKEET_MEETING_ECHO_MODEL_SHA256=b6e43138588a83bfe903ab5e143b4020b91c1e1629f5a575ac5855ff0003c731
export REQUIRE_MEETING_ECHO_ASSETS=1
VERSION=X.Y.Z scripts/dist/build_app_bundle.sh
```

`build_app_bundle.sh` preserves the source GGUF filename by default; override
with `MACPARAKEET_MEETING_ECHO_MODEL_NAME=<filename>.gguf` only when the source
path is not the intended bundled name. The bundled runtime is copied to
`Contents/Frameworks/liblocalvqe.dylib`; the selected model is copied under
`Contents/Resources/MeetingEchoSuppression/`. Release bundles must contain
exactly one GGUF model so asset verification and runtime model resolution cannot
drift.

`scripts/dist/verify_meeting_echo_assets.sh dist/MacParakeet.app` is the release
gate. With `REQUIRE_MEETING_ECHO_ASSETS=1`, it fails if either asset is missing,
if the model checksum does not match, if `liblocalvqe.dylib` is not executable,
if required LocalVQE C symbols are not exported, or if `otool -L` shows
non-portable dylib references outside `@rpath`, `@loader_path`, `/System/Library`,
or `/usr/lib`. Without `REQUIRE_MEETING_ECHO_ASSETS=1`, missing assets are
accepted and the app intentionally runs the meeting echo path as passthrough.

Retained purchase activation config (normally unset in current free builds):

```bash
export MACPARAKEET_CHECKOUT_URL="https://..."
export MACPARAKEET_LS_VARIANT_ID="12345"
scripts/dist/build_app_bundle.sh
```

Current public MacParakeet builds are free/GPL-3.0 and
`EntitlementsService.currentState()` returns unlocked. These variables are
retained for future GPL-compatible official paid distribution/support and are
not required for current free production builds. When set, they are embedded
into `Info.plist` as:
- `MacParakeetCheckoutURL`
- `MacParakeetLemonSqueezyVariantID`

## 2) Sign + notarize (recommended)

Prereqs:
- A **Developer ID Application** certificate in Keychain.
- `notarytool` credentials stored in Keychain under the profile `AC_PASSWORD` (shared with Oatmeal):

```bash
xcrun notarytool store-credentials "AC_PASSWORD" \
  --apple-id "moona3k@gmail.com" \
  --team-id "FYAF2ZD7RM" \
  --password "app-specific-password"
```

Verify credentials work:

```bash
xcrun notarytool history --keychain-profile "AC_PASSWORD"
```

Then:

```bash
scripts/dist/sign_notarize.sh
```

The script defaults `NOTARYTOOL_PROFILE` to `AC_PASSWORD`. Override with `NOTARYTOOL_PROFILE="other" scripts/dist/sign_notarize.sh` if needed.

Outputs:
- `dist/MacParakeet.app` (signed + stapled)
- `dist/MacParakeet.dmg` (signed + stapled)

## 3) Upload to Cloudflare R2

The signed DMG is hosted on Cloudflare R2 at `downloads.macparakeet.com`.

**Bucket:** `macparakeet-downloads` (Cloudflare R2)
**Custom domain:** `downloads.macparakeet.com`
**Public URL:** `https://downloads.macparakeet.com/MacParakeet.dmg`

Upload a new release:

```bash
npx wrangler r2 object put macparakeet-downloads/MacParakeet.dmg \
  --file dist/MacParakeet.dmg \
  --content-type "application/x-apple-diskimage" \
  --remote
```

Verify:

```bash
curl -sI https://downloads.macparakeet.com/MacParakeet.dmg | head -5
```

Because Cloudflare may serve a cached object briefly, also verify with a cache-busting query:

```bash
curl -sI "https://downloads.macparakeet.com/MacParakeet.dmg?ts=$(date +%s)" | head -10
```

Confirm `content-length`, `last-modified`, and `etag` match the newly uploaded DMG.

## Full release workflow

**IMPORTANT:** Follow these steps in exact order. Do NOT re-upload the DMG after signing for Sparkle — the file size must match the appcast signature. If another agent is running a parallel build, coordinate to avoid overwriting the R2 object.

This pipeline serves **two audiences** with the same DMG:
- **New users** download from `downloads.macparakeet.com/MacParakeet.dmg`
- **Existing users** get prompted via Sparkle auto-update (checks `appcast.xml`)

### Pre-flight

Before building, verify the codebase is ready:

```bash
# All tests must pass
swift test

# Distribution privacy/entitlement guard runs after signing, but this source
# file is the expected entitlement surface for the final app.
plutil -p scripts/dist/MacParakeet.entitlements

# Check currently deployed version
curl -s "https://macparakeet.com/appcast.xml" | grep -E "sparkle:version|sparkle:shortVersionString"
```

Decide on the version number (see Version bumping below).

### Version bumping

The build script accepts `VERSION` and `BUILD_NUMBER` env vars:

```bash
VERSION=0.1.1 scripts/dist/build_app_bundle.sh   # set version explicitly
scripts/dist/build_app_bundle.sh                   # local/dev only: VERSION defaults to 0.0.0
```

- **Patch bump** (0.1.x): Bug fixes, UX improvements to existing features
- **Minor bump** (0.x.0): New user-facing features (e.g., speaker diarization GUI, batch processing)
- **Build number**: Auto-generated UTC timestamp — always increases, which is what Sparkle uses to detect updates
- Both new downloads (R2 DMG) and existing users (Sparkle appcast) get the same DMG
- **Release builds must set `VERSION=X.Y.Z` explicitly.** The script's default
  `0.0.0` is intentionally non-release metadata so local bundles cannot be
  mistaken for a production Sparkle update.

### Step 1: Build

```bash
VERSION=X.Y.Z scripts/dist/build_app_bundle.sh
```

Verify: Look for `Embedded Sparkle.framework` and `Adding @executable_path/../Frameworks to rpath` in the output. For AEC-ready releases, also look for `Meeting echo assets verified`; the explicit post-build check is:

```bash
REQUIRE_MEETING_ECHO_ASSETS=1 scripts/dist/verify_meeting_echo_assets.sh dist/MacParakeet.app
```

The script will `exit 1` if Sparkle is missing or required echo assets fail verification.

### Step 2: Sign + notarize

```bash
scripts/dist/sign_notarize.sh
```

The script defaults `NOTARYTOOL_PROFILE` to `AC_PASSWORD`. Both app and DMG are signed, notarized, and stapled. The script submits and polls for completion — **never use `notarytool submit --wait`** (it crashes with a bus error; see gotcha #1 below).

Verify:
```bash
spctl --assess --type execute --verbose=4 dist/MacParakeet.app
# Expected: "accepted / source=Notarized Developer ID"

dist/MacParakeet.app/Contents/Resources/yt-dlp --version
# Expected: prints a yt-dlp version, not a [PYI:ERROR] Python shared library failure
```

### Step 3: Upload DMG to R2

```bash
npx wrangler r2 object put macparakeet-downloads/MacParakeet.dmg \
  --file dist/MacParakeet.dmg \
  --content-type "application/x-apple-diskimage" \
  --remote
```

Verify — **the file size MUST match `dist/MacParakeet.dmg` exactly:**
```bash
LOCAL_SIZE=$(stat -f%z dist/MacParakeet.dmg)
REMOTE_SIZE=$(curl -sI "https://downloads.macparakeet.com/MacParakeet.dmg?ts=$(date +%s)" | grep -i content-length | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '\r')
echo "Local: $LOCAL_SIZE  Remote: $REMOTE_SIZE"
# These MUST be identical. If not, re-upload — another process may have overwritten the object.
```

### Step 4: Sign DMG for Sparkle

```bash
.build/artifacts/sparkle/Sparkle/bin/sign_update dist/MacParakeet.dmg
```

This outputs two values you need for the appcast:
```
sparkle:edSignature="..." length="..."
```

**The `length` must match the R2 `content-length` from Step 3.** If they differ, something went wrong — do NOT proceed.

### Step 5: Update appcast.xml

Edit `~/code/macparakeet-website/public/appcast.xml`. **Prepend** a new `<item>` at the top of the channel (keep all previous items — Sparkle shows release notes for ALL versions newer than the user's installed version, so users who skip versions see the full changelog).

New item needs:
- `sparkle:version` = build number from `dist/MacParakeet.app/Contents/Info.plist` (`CFBundleVersion`)
- `sparkle:shortVersionString` = version from Info.plist (`CFBundleShortVersionString`)
- `sparkle:edSignature` and `length` from Step 4
- `pubDate` in RFC 2822 format: `date -R`
- Release notes in `<description>` CDATA block — only what's new in THIS version (don't duplicate notes from previous items)
- **Enclosure URL must include a cache-busting query param:** `?v={BUILD_NUMBER}`. Cloudflare CDN caches by full URL including query params, so without this Sparkle may download a stale cached DMG and fail with "improperly signed". R2 ignores query params and serves the correct object.

Keep ~10 most recent items. Prune older ones when the list gets long. Only the newest item's enclosure URL is used for download — old items just provide their release notes.

Get build info:
```bash
plutil -p dist/MacParakeet.app/Contents/Info.plist | grep -E "CFBundleVersion|CFBundleShortVersionString"
```

### Step 6: Deploy website

```bash
cd ~/code/macparakeet-website
git add public/appcast.xml
git commit -m "Update appcast.xml with vX.Y.Z build BUILDNUMBER"
git push
# Then deploy to Cloudflare Pages:
npx astro build && npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name macparakeet-website --branch main
```

Verify appcast is live:
```bash
curl -s "https://macparakeet.com/appcast.xml?ts=$(date +%s)" | grep "sparkle:version"
```

### Step 7: Verify end-to-end

1. Confirm R2 file size matches appcast `length`
2. Confirm appcast `sparkle:version` is newer than the installed app's build number
3. Launch the app → "Check for Updates..." from the menu bar → should find and validate the update
4. Confirm the GitHub release `vX.Y.Z` includes an asset named **exactly**
   `MacParakeet.dmg`. The official Homebrew cask fetches
   `…/releases/download/v#{version}/MacParakeet.dmg` — the version lives in the
   tag path, **not** the filename. BrewTestBot cannot autobump the cask until
   that plain-named asset exists on the new tag. (Attaching only a
   `MacParakeet-X.Y.Z.dmg` is not enough; v0.6.20 shipped without the plain
   `MacParakeet.dmg` and the cask could not bump to it.)

## Standalone CLI Homebrew release

The app DMG/Sparkle channel and the standalone CLI Homebrew channel are
separate releases. The CLI release ships a signed standalone
`macparakeet-cli` binary attached to a `cli-vX.Y.Z` GitHub release, then
updates the formula in <https://github.com/moona3k/homebrew-tap>.

Use [`scripts/dist/homebrew-tap-scaffold/HOWTO.md`](../scripts/dist/homebrew-tap-scaffold/HOWTO.md)
for the exact checklist. At minimum:

1. Bump `Sources/CLI/MacParakeetCLI.swift` and
   `Sources/CLI/CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Build `swift build -c release --product macparakeet-cli`.
3. Sign the binary with Developer ID, notarize the zip, and publish the
   tarball/checksums to `cli-vX.Y.Z`.
4. Update `Formula/macparakeet-cli.rb` in `moona3k/homebrew-tap` with the
   release URL, version, and tarball SHA256.
5. Verify from the tap:

```bash
brew reinstall moona3k/tap/macparakeet-cli
macparakeet-cli --version
macparakeet-cli health --json
brew test moona3k/tap/macparakeet-cli
```

Do not call the CLI fully released until both the GitHub release asset and
the tap formula are live and the fresh Homebrew install path passes.

### Common pitfalls

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| App crashes at launch (dyld) | Sparkle.framework missing from bundle | Build script should catch this. If bypassed, re-run `build_app_bundle.sh` |
| "Improperly signed" update error | R2 file doesn't match appcast signature, OR Cloudflare CDN cached an old DMG | Re-upload the **exact same DMG** you ran `sign_update` on. Verify sizes match. **Always use `?v={BUILD_NUMBER}` in the appcast enclosure URL** to bust Cloudflare's CDN cache |
| Appcast not updating | Cloudflare Pages cache / build not triggered | Deploy manually: `npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name macparakeet-website` |
| Homebrew cask stays behind appcast | GitHub release is missing `MacParakeet-X.Y.Z.dmg`, even if `MacParakeet.dmg` exists | Upload the exact shipped DMG to the GitHub release with the versioned filename, then wait for BrewTestBot's autobump cycle |
| `notarytool` auth failure | Keychain profile missing | Run `xcrun notarytool store-credentials "AC_PASSWORD"` (see Step 2 above) |
| Update found but same version | Build number in appcast ≤ installed build | Ensure `sparkle:version` (build number) is strictly greater |
| `notarytool` bus error / crash | Using `--wait` flag | **Never use `xcrun notarytool submit --wait`.** Submit without `--wait`, then poll with `xcrun notarytool info <submission-id>`. See gotcha #1 below. |
| `notarytool` stays `In Progress` beyond the normal window | Apple accepted upload but the submission is likely stale/stuck | Stop local pollers, discard release artifacts, rebuild/sign from scratch, and submit a fresh archive. Do not continue from orphaned `In Progress` submissions. See gotcha #1a below. |
| TCC permissions silently fail | User ran app from DMG volume instead of /Applications | DMG must include Applications symlink. See gotcha #3 below. |
| YouTube transcription fails with `[PYI:ERROR] Failed to load Python shared library ... different Team IDs` | Bundled `yt-dlp_macos` was re-signed with hardened runtime but without disabling library validation | Sign `yt-dlp` with `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation=true`, smoke-test `Contents/Resources/yt-dlp --version`, and repair any bad managed copy in Application Support |

### Known gotchas (hard-won lessons)

These are bugs and edge cases discovered during actual releases. Read before your first release.

#### 1. `notarytool --wait` crashes with bus error

**Never use the `--wait` flag** with `xcrun notarytool submit`. It crashes with a bus error (EXC_BAD_ACCESS) on some macOS versions. This is an Apple bug that has persisted across multiple Xcode releases.

**Instead:** Submit without `--wait` and poll for completion:

```bash
# Submit (returns a submission ID)
xcrun notarytool submit dist/MacParakeet.dmg --keychain-profile "AC_PASSWORD"
# Note the submission ID from the output

# Poll until status is "Accepted" or "Invalid"
xcrun notarytool info <SUBMISSION_ID> --keychain-profile "AC_PASSWORD"
```

The `sign_notarize.sh` script already handles this correctly — it submits and polls in a loop. If you're running notarization manually, never add `--wait`.

#### 1a. Restart from clean artifacts if notarization stalls

Normal notarization usually returns `Accepted` in roughly 2-5 minutes. If a
fresh app or DMG submission stays `In Progress` well beyond that window, treat
the submission as stale instead of waiting indefinitely. This can happen even
when `notarytool submit` produced a valid submission ID.

For a clean restart:

```bash
# Stop any local release pollers first.
ps -axo pid,ppid,etime,command | rg 'notarytool|sign_notarize|build_app_bundle|hdiutil'

# Then discard generated release artifacts and rebuild/sign fresh.
rm -rf dist/MacParakeet.app dist/MacParakeet.app.zip \
  dist/MacParakeet.dmg dist/MacParakeet-rw.dmg dist/.dmg-staging
VERSION=X.Y.Z scripts/dist/build_app_bundle.sh
SKIP_NOTARIZE=1 CREATE_DMG=0 scripts/dist/sign_notarize.sh
```

Submit the newly-created archive and poll that exact fresh submission ID. Only
staple, DMG, upload, or update Sparkle after a clean `Accepted` response for the
artifact you are actually shipping.

#### 2. Cloudflare CDN caches R2 objects — Sparkle cache-busting is mandatory

Cloudflare CDN caches R2 objects with a ~4 hour TTL based on the full URL including query params. If the appcast enclosure URL is a bare `MacParakeet.dmg` without a cache-busting param, Sparkle may download a **stale cached DMG** from a previous release and reject it with "improperly signed".

**The fix:** Always include `?v={BUILD_NUMBER}` in the appcast enclosure URL:

```xml
<enclosure
  url="https://downloads.macparakeet.com/MacParakeet.dmg?v=20260329195139"
  ...
/>
```

R2 ignores query params and serves the current object. Cloudflare CDN treats the new URL as a cache miss and fetches fresh. Each build has a unique build number, so each release gets its own cache slot.

**How to verify:** After uploading, compare local and remote file sizes:

```bash
LOCAL_SIZE=$(stat -f%z dist/MacParakeet.dmg)
REMOTE_SIZE=$(curl -sI "https://downloads.macparakeet.com/MacParakeet.dmg?v=$(plutil -extract CFBundleVersion raw dist/MacParakeet.app/Contents/Info.plist)" | grep -i content-length | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '\r')
echo "Local: $LOCAL_SIZE  Remote: $REMOTE_SIZE"
# MUST be identical. If not, wait and retry — CDN propagation can take a few seconds.
```

#### 3. DMG must include Applications symlink

Without `ln -s /Applications` in the DMG staging folder, users run the app from `/Volumes/MacParakeet/` instead of `/Applications/`. macOS TCC will not register apps running from a mounted DMG volume — microphone permission requests silently fail, and the app never appears in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone.

The `sign_notarize.sh` script creates this symlink during DMG creation. If building a DMG manually, always include it:

```bash
ln -s /Applications dist/dmg-staging/Applications
```

#### 4. The DMG uploaded to R2 must be the exact file you signed for Sparkle

The Sparkle `sign_update` tool produces an EdDSA signature over the exact bytes of the DMG file. If a different DMG (even with identical content but different creation timestamp) is uploaded to R2, Sparkle will reject the update.

**Pipeline order matters:**
1. Build → Sign + notarize → DMG created
2. Upload **that DMG** to R2
3. Run `sign_update` on **that same DMG**
4. Put the signature in the appcast

If another process or agent overwrites the R2 object between steps 2 and 3, the signature won't match. Always verify file sizes match after upload (Step 3 in the release workflow).

#### 5. `yt-dlp_macos` is PyInstaller and needs a special signing entitlement

MacParakeet bundles `yt-dlp` as a helper seed. Fresh installs copy that seed
from `Contents/Resources/yt-dlp` into
`~/Library/Application Support/MacParakeet/bin/yt-dlp` before first YouTube
transcription. Existing users may already have a working managed helper, so a
bad bundled seed can appear as a fresh-install-only bug.

The official `yt-dlp_macos` asset is a PyInstaller binary. If the release script
re-signs it with Developer ID + hardened runtime but does not include
`com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation=true`, macOS library
validation blocks PyInstaller's extracted embedded `Python.framework` at runtime:

```text
[PYI:ERROR] Failed to load Python shared library ... different Team IDs
```

This fails when a user starts YouTube transcription or opens the YouTube video
playback stream extraction path. It does not affect dictation, local file
transcription, meeting recording, or STT model loading.

Release requirements:
- Sign bundled `yt-dlp` with hardened runtime plus `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation=true`, or do not apply hardened runtime to that helper.
- Smoke-test after signing: `dist/MacParakeet.app/Contents/Resources/yt-dlp --version`.
- If a bad build shipped, repair existing users by replacing
  `~/Library/Application Support/MacParakeet/bin/yt-dlp`; a fixed bundled seed
  alone will not help users who already copied the bad managed helper.

## Auto-Updates (Sparkle)

MacParakeet uses [Sparkle 2](https://sparkle-project.org/) for in-app auto-updates. Users are prompted when a new version is available — no manual DMG download needed.

### How it works

1. On launch, Sparkle checks `https://macparakeet.com/appcast.xml` for new versions
2. If a newer version exists, a native update dialog appears
3. User clicks "Install Update" → Sparkle downloads the DMG, replaces the app, relaunches

### EdDSA signing keys

The private key is stored in the developer's macOS Keychain (generated once via `generate_keys`). The public key is embedded in `Info.plist` as `SUPublicEDKey`.

To retrieve the public key or verify the Keychain entry:

```bash
.build/artifacts/sparkle/Sparkle/bin/generate_keys
```

### Appcast

The appcast XML lives in the [macparakeet-website](https://github.com/moona3k/macparakeet-website) repo at `public/appcast.xml` and is served at `https://macparakeet.com/appcast.xml`.

Template for a new item (prepend to existing items in `appcast.xml`):

```xml
    <item>
      <title>Version X.Y.Z</title>
      <link>https://macparakeet.com</link>
      <sparkle:version>BUILD_NUMBER</sparkle:version>
      <sparkle:shortVersionString>X.Y.Z</sparkle:shortVersionString>
      <sparkle:minimumSystemVersion>14.2</sparkle:minimumSystemVersion>
      <description><![CDATA[
        <h2>What's New</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Feature or fix description</li>
        </ul>
      ]]></description>
      <pubDate>DATE_RFC2822</pubDate>
      <enclosure
        url="https://downloads.macparakeet.com/MacParakeet.dmg?v=BUILD_NUMBER"
        sparkle:edSignature="SIGNATURE_FROM_SIGN_UPDATE"
        length="FILE_SIZE_BYTES"
        type="application/octet-stream" />
    </item>
```

**Important:** Don't replace existing items — prepend the new one. Sparkle shows all items newer than the user's installed version. Keep ~10 items for users who skip versions.

### Signing an update

```bash
# Sign the DMG and get the signature + length for appcast.xml
.build/artifacts/sparkle/Sparkle/bin/sign_update dist/MacParakeet.dmg
```

This outputs `sparkle:edSignature="..."` and `length="..."` — paste both into the appcast `<enclosure>` element.

### Auto-generate appcast from a directory of releases

```bash
# Place all versioned DMGs in a directory, then:
.build/artifacts/sparkle/Sparkle/bin/generate_appcast /path/to/releases/
```

This generates/updates `appcast.xml` with signatures and optional delta updates.

### Info.plist keys

These are set automatically by `build_app_bundle.sh`:

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `SUFeedURL` | `https://macparakeet.com/appcast.xml` |
| `SUPublicEDKey` | `2aqRU0Agz+xxZwt0kLybmKz/SAvZUsyn+z9fU0I6ynY=` |

### Privacy Strings and Entitlements

Permission prompts require both the appropriate `Info.plist` usage string and
the matching signed app entitlement when macOS gates access through TCC. The
release signing script runs `scripts/dist/verify_app_privacy_surface.sh` after
codesigning to catch drift before notarization.

| Capability | Info.plist key | Entitlement |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| Microphone input | `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` | `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` |
| System audio capture | `NSAudioCaptureUsageDescription` | macOS TCC prompt, no app entitlement |
| Calendar event read access | `NSCalendarsFullAccessUsageDescription` | `com.apple.security.personal-information.calendars` |

Microphone-only meeting capture uses only the Microphone permission and never
triggers the System Audio (Screen Recording) prompt; system audio is requested
only for source modes that capture it.

### Settings UI

Users can control auto-update behavior in Settings > Updates:
- Toggle automatic update checks
- Toggle automatic update downloads
- Manual "Check for Updates..." button

"Check for Updates..." is also available in the app menu and menu bar dropdown.

## Notes

- **Sparkle.framework must be embedded in the .app bundle.** The `build_app_bundle.sh` script copies it to `Contents/Frameworks/`. If the framework is missing, the app will crash immediately at launch with a dyld `Library not loaded: @rpath/Sparkle.framework` error. The script now fails the build if Sparkle.framework cannot be found — do not bypass this check.
- The scripts default to a single-arch Release build. For a universal binary:

```bash
UNIVERSAL=1 scripts/dist/build_app_bundle.sh
```

- `MacParakeet` requests microphone permission. The app bundle `Info.plist` includes `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`.
- **Users must install to /Applications before launching.** Running directly from a mounted DMG (`/Volumes/MacParakeet/`) will not register with macOS TCC — the app won't appear in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone, and permission requests will silently fail. The DMG includes an Applications symlink for drag-to-install.
- If a user's microphone permission gets stuck as "Denied", reset it with: `tccutil reset Microphone com.macparakeet.MacParakeet`
